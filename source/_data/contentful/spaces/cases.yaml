  whatDataShared: 'Private buses known as matatus are the primary mode of motorized
    transport in Nairobi. In a collaborative effort called Digital Matatus, researchers
    from Columbia University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University
    of Nairobi used GPS tracking devices and smartphone data to create a digital map
    of Nairobi’s matatu routes. '
  howDataShared: University of Nairobi students geolocated stops along routes and
    recorded important information such as which stops are formally recognized by
    the city. This map and database is  openly available through Global Transit Feed
    Specification (GTFS) format. With this, Kenyan tech start-ups have developed useful
    mobile applications for Nairobi’s citizens to suggest optimal routes, provide
    warnings about unsafe areas near matatu stops, and allow users to hail matatus
    by requesting pick-up at a specific location.
  purpose: The Digital Matatus project helped passengers discover more efficient commuting
    routes. The new dataset will also help regulate bus stop locations; the project
    found that many buses stop erratically along the road to pick up passengers, with
    detrimental effects on traffic. The data collected by this project is also the
    first official record of existing routes. This information facilitates civic engagement
    and feedback during the transit planning process to incorporate some of the matatu
    routes into formal bus routes offered by the city.

    digital assets to better inform and protect human health.
  howDataShared: 'The BD2K initiative encourages the broad use of biomedical digital
    assets by making them discoverable, accessible, and citable. In doing so, researchers
    need to take into account complex security issues, as Vivien Bonazzi, programme
    director in computational biology and bioinformatics at the National Human Genome
    Research Institute explains: "When a person consents to have his or her data used
    in one way, researchers cannot suddenly change that use, she says. In a big-data
    age that uses the cloud in addition to local hardware, new technologies in encryption
    and secure transmission will need to address such privacy concerns"'
  purpose: As biomedical datasets become increasingly large, diverse, and complex,
    they tax conventional methods for sharing, managing, and analyzing data. Additionally,
    researchers’ abilities to capitalize on biomedical big data science-based approaches
    are limited by poor data accessibility and interoperability, the lack of appropriate
    tools, and insufficient training. The BD2K initiative acts as a trans-NIH, community-enabled
    endeavor towards maximizing the collective value of current and future biomedical
    digital assets to better inform and protect human health. The aims of the BD2K
    initiative are to facilitate broad use of biomedical digital assets by making
    them discoverable, accessible, and citable; to conduct research and develop the
    methods, software, and tools needed to fully analyze biomedical big data; to enhance
    training in the development and use of methods and tools necessary for biomedical

  whatDataShared: The Global Forest Watch (GFW) collects crowdsouced and geographical
    data to track envornmental degradation, particularly deforestation, around the
    world. Its ArcGIS Online portal is an analytical tool that allows users to use
    this forest data in a GIS cloud environment. ArcGIS Online resources include thousands
    of authoritative datasets, references, and thematic maps about hundreds of topics.
    Users can also contribute to GFW by sharing data and stories from the ground via
    GFW’s crowdsourcing tools, blogs, and discussion groups. Special “apps” provide
    detailed information for companies that wish to reduce the risk of deforestation
    in their supply chains, users who want to monitor fires across Southeast Asia,
    and more.
  howDataShared: "Data on Global Forest Watch come from a variety of sources, including
    governments, NGOs, academia, and industry. To acquire new data, they research
    and incorporate available open data, form partnerships to move data into the public
    domain, and fund the creation of datasets to fill key gaps in their database.
    \ Generally, the process begins with a conversation between GFW and the data provider
    about which data sets will be visualized. The data provider will then be asked
    to sign a Data Sharing Agreement, which gives Global Forest Watch permission to
    visualize the data on the website and (in most cases) make the data downloadable.
    \n"
  purpose: |-
    In its Data Playbook, Global Forest Watch lists three central intended impacts:
    1. Improve the accuracy or timeliness of forest change detection.
    2. Illustrate drivers of change, including land use and industrial activity. Priority sectors include logging, mining, agricultural commodities (palm oil, beef, soy, etc.), and infrastructure.
    3. Indicate the health or status of remaining forests, such as biodiversity, landscape connectivity, or carbon.”

    The ultimate goal is to allow a wide array of stakeholders to provide data and track deforectation, in an effort to campaign for change and more sustainable environemntal practices.

    terms. Google shared these search query-based data in conjunction with the U.S.
    Centers for Disease Control in order to estimate levels of influenza activity
    over time. '
  howDataShared: The premise of Google Flu Trends was to combine data from the CDC
    with search terms containing flu-related information. Researchers proposed that
    these search data tuned into flu tracking information from the Centers for Disease
    Control and Prevention, could "nowcast" estimates of flu prevalence. But, the
    first version of Google Flu Trends was flawed in its data collection and modelling
    practices.  Its methodology was to find the best matches among 50 million search
    terms to fit 1152 data points. But, since the alogorithm was too broad and the
    big data often overfitted the case--for instance, mistakenly identifying seasonal
    search terms, like “high school basketball,” as flu predictions--Google Flu Trends
    missed 2013's peak flu season by 140 percent. The project now exists as a compilation
    of historical estimates, though it has also inspired several other similar projects
    that use social media data to predict disease trends.
  purpose: The goal of Google Flu Trends was to use search data to monitor health
    tracking behaviors online, and to reveal the presence of flu-like illness in a
    population. The intention was to identify disease activity early and respond quickly
    to reduce the impact of seasonal and pandemic influenza. One report was that Google
    Flu Trends was able to predict regional outbreaks of flu up to 10 days before
    they were reported by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). But,
    because of flaws in the project and analysis, none of these goals were attained
    to any sufficient standard.

  whatDataShared: IBM launched the Smarter Solutions initiative as a way to introduce
    technological innovation in Canada's healthcare system by accessing healthcare
    data from participating hospitals. This information was then used to create computerized
    systems to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare providers. Canada's
    healthcare organizations have entered into a contract with IBM to deliver this
    service, so unlike many other data collaboratives these data sharing processes
    are part of a commercial relationship.
  howDataShared: 'IBM''s Smarter Solutions attempts to put in place what is called
    "cognitive computing"—systems that try to understand, reason and learn while interacting
    with humans. They are designed to ingest vast quantities of structured and unstructured
    information—from numbers and text to audio, video, images, sensory and other data,
    and to help physicians and researchers identify new patterns and insights to accelerate
    discoveries, treatments and insights. '
  purpose: New tools to analyze and glean the relevant information from this ocean
    of data are helping practitioners, researchers and caregivers discover new healthcare
    solutions and apply them in innovative ways. Cognitive-based systems that build
    knowledge and learn can bridge the gap between vast amounts of data available
    and its relationship to the questions that need to be asked.

  shortDescription: An analysis of aggregated and anonymized call details records
    (CDR) conducted in collaboration with the UN, Government of Mexico, academia and
    Telefonica suggests high potential in using shared telecom data to improve early
    warning and emergency management mechanisms.
  annotation: |-
    This report describes the impact of using mobile data in order to understand the impact of disasters and improve disaster management. The report was conducted in the Mexican state of Tabasco in 2009 as a multidisciplinary, multi-stakeholder consortium involving the UN World Food Programme (WFP), Telefonica Research, Technical University of Madrid (UPM), Digital Strategy Coordination Office of the President of Mexico, and UN Global Pulse.

    Telefonica Research, a division of the major Latin American telecommunications company, provided call detail records covering flood-affected areas for nine months. This data was combined with “remote sensing data (satellite images), rainfall data, census and civil protection data.” The results of the data demonstrated that “analysing mobile activity during floods could be used to potentially locate damaged areas, efficiently assess needs and allocate resources (for example, sending supplies to affected areas).”

    In addition to the results, the study highlighted “the value of a public-private partnership on using mobile data to accurately indicate flooding impacts in Tabasco, thus improving early warning and crisis management.”

    The authors of this report provide a “systematic literature of potential barriers to public health data sharing.” These twenty potential barriers are classified in six categories: “technical, motivational, economic, political, legal and ethical.” In this taxonomy, “the first three categories are deeply rooted in well-known challenges of health information systems for which structural solutions have yet to be found; the last three have solutions that lie in an international dialogue aimed at generating consensus on policies and instruments for data sharing.”

    The authors suggest the need for a “systematic framework of barriers to data sharing in public health” in order to accelerate access and use of data for public good.

  shortDescription: A paper describing how data, such as privately held mobile phone
    data – could improve development policy.
  annotation: |-
    This journal article describes how privately held data – namely “digital traces” of consumer activity – “are becoming seen by policymakers and researchers as a potential solution to the lack of reliable statistical data on lower-income countries."

    They focus especially on three categories of data collaborative use cases:
    - Mobile data as a predictive tool for issues such as human mobility and economic activity;
    - Use of mobile data to inform humanitarian response to crises; and
    - Use of born-digital web data as a tool for predicting economic trends, and the implications these have for LMICs.

    They note, however, that a number of challenges and drawbacks exist for these types of use cases, including:
    - Access to private data sources often must be negotiated or bought, “which potentially means substituting negotiations with corporations for those with national statistical offices;”
    - The meaning of such data is not always simple or stable, and local knowledge is needed to understand how people are using the technologies in question
    - Bias in proprietary data can be hard to understand and quantify;
    - Lack of privacy frameworks; and
    - Power asymmetries, wherein “LMIC citizens are unwittingly placed in a panopticon staffed by international researchers, with no way out and no legal recourse.”

    at the International Data Responsibility Conference focused on identifying emerging
    practices, opportunities and challenges confronting data collaboratives.\n\nThe
    authors list a number of privately held data sources that could create positive
    public impacts if made more accessible in a collaborative manner, including:\n-
    Data for early warning systems to help mitigate the effects of natural disasters;\n-
    Data to help understand human behavior as it relates to nutrition and livelihoods
    in developing countries;\n- Data to monitor compliance with weapons treaties;\n-
    Data to more accurately measure progress related to the UN Sustainable Development
    Goals.\n \nTo the end of identifying and expanding on emerging practice in the
    space, the authors describe a number of current data collaborative experiments,
    including:\n- __Trusted Intermediaries__: Statistics Netherlands partnered with
    Vodafone to analyze mobile call data records in order to better understand mobility
    patterns and inform urban planning.\n- __Prizes and Challenges__: Orange Telecom,
    which has been a leader in this type of Data Collaboration, provided several examples
    of the company’s initiatives, such as the use of call data records to track the
    spread of malaria as well as their experience with Challenge 4 Development.\n-
    __Research partnerships__: The Data for Climate Action project is an ongoing large-scale
    initiative incentivizing companies to share their data to help researchers answer
    particular scientific questions related to climate change and adaptation.\n- __Sharing
    intelligence products__: JPMorgan Chase shares macro economic insights they gained
    leveraging their data through the newly established JPMorgan Chase Institute.\n\nIn
    order to capitalize on the opportunities provided by data collaboratives, a number
    of needs were identified:\n- A responsible data framework;\n- Increased insight
    into different business models that may facilitate the sharing of data;\n- Capacity
    to tap into the potential value of data;\n- Transparent stock of available data

  annotation: |-
    The paper presents a research study conducted on the basis of the mobile calls records shared with researchers in the framework of the Data for Development Challenge by the mobile operator Orange.

    The study discusses the data analysis approach in relation to developing a situation of Ebola diffusion built around “the interactions of multi-scale models, including viral loads (at the cellular level), disease progression (at the individual person level), disease propagation (at the workplace and family level), societal changes in migration and travel movements (at the population level), and mitigating interventions (at the abstract government policy level).”

    The authors argue that the use of their population, mobility, and simulation models provide more accurate simulation details in comparison to high-level analytical predictions and that the D4D mobile datasets provide high-resolution information useful for modeling developing regions and hard to reach locations.

  shortDescription: A journal article primarily focused on the risks involved in health
    data pooling.
  annotation: |-
    This journal article explores the benefits and, in particular, the risks related to large-scale biomedical databases bringing together health information from a diversity of sources across sectors. Some data collaboratives examined in the piece include:
    - __MedMining__ – a company that extracts EHR data, de-identifies it, and offers it to researchers. The data sets that MedMining delivers to its customers include ‘lab results, vital signs, medications, procedures, diagnoses, lifestyle data, and detailed costs’ from inpatient and outpatient facilities.
    - __Explorys__ has formed a large healthcare database derived from financial, administrative, and medical records. It has partnered with major healthcare organizations such as the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and Summa Health System to aggregate and standardize health information from ten million patients and over thirty billion clinical events.

    Hoffman and Podgurski note that biomedical databases populated have many potential uses, with those likely to benefit including: “researchers, regulators, public health officials, commercial entities, lawyers,” as well as “healthcare providers who conduct quality assessment and improvement activities,” regulatory monitoring entities like the FDA, and “litigants in tort cases to develop evidence concerning causation and harm.”

    They argue, however, that risks arise based on:
    - The data contained in biomedical databases is surprisingly likely to be incorrect or incomplete;
    - Systemic biases, arising from both the nature of the data and the preconceptions of investigators are serious threats the validity of research results, especially in answering causal questions;
    - Data mining of biomedical databases makes it easier for individuals with political, social, or economic agendas to generate ostensibly scientific but misleading research findings for the purpose of manipulating public opinion and swaying policymakers.

    filtering of sensitive information and aggregation of data,” and access control
    mechanisms built around identity management and regulated access.  \n- __Economic__.
    Interventions include a model where data is shared only with a few trusted organizations,
    and yield management mechanisms to ensure negative financial consequences are
    avoided.\n- __Data quality__. Interventions include identifying additional data
    sources that could improve the completeness of datasets, and efforts to improve
    metadata.\n- __Technical__. Interventions include making data available in structured

    real-world problems. He also describes a number of initiatives underway at Bloomberg
    along these lines.    \n\nMann argues that data generated at private companies
    “could enable amazing discoveries and research,” but is often inaccessible to
    those who could put it to those uses. Beyond research, he notes that corporate
    data could, for instance, benefit:\n- Public health – including suicide prevention,
    addiction counseling and mental health monitoring.\n- Legal and ethical questions
    – especially as they relate to “the role algorithms have in decisions about our
    lives,” such as credit checks and resume screening.\n\nMann recognizes the privacy
    challenges inherent in private sector data sharing, but argues that it is a common
    misconception that the only two choices are “complete privacy or complete disclosure.”
    He believes that flexible frameworks for differential privacy could open up new
    opportunities for responsibly leveraging data collaboratives."

  shortDescription: A white paper describing the potential of big data, and corporate
    data in particular, to positively benefit development efforts.
  annotation: |-
    This white paper, produced by “a group of activists, researchers and data experts” explores the potential of big data to improve development outcomes and spur positive social change in low- and middle-income countries. Using examples, the authors discuss four areas in which the use of big data can impact development efforts:
    - Advocating and facilitating by “opening[ing] up new public spaces for discussion and awareness building;
    - Describing and predicting through the detection of “new correlations and the surfac[ing] of new questions;
    -  Facilitating information exchange through “multiple feedback loops which feed into both research and action,” and
    -  Promoting accountability and transparency, especially as a byproduct of crowdsourcing efforts aimed at “aggregat[ing] and analyz[ing] information in real time.

    The authors argue that in order to maximize the potential of big data’s use in development, “there is a case to be made for building a data commons for private/public data, and for setting up new and more appropriate ethical guidelines.”

    They also identify a number of challenges, especially when leveraging data made accessible from a number of sources, including private sector entities, such as:
    - Lack of general data literacy;
    - Lack of open learning environments and repositories;
    - Lack of resources, capacity and access;
    - Challenges of sensitivity and risk perception with regard to using data;
    - Storage and computing capacity; and
    - Externally validating data sources for comparison and verification.

    This Chatham House report provides an overview on public health surveillance data sharing, highlighting the benefits and challenges of shared health data and the complexity in adapting technical solutions from other sectors for public health.

    The report describes data sharing processes from several perspectives, including in-depth case studies of actual data sharing in practice at the individual, organizational and sector levels. Among the key lessons for public health data sharing, the report strongly highlights the need to harness momentum for action and maintain collaborative engagement: “Successful data sharing communities are highly collaborative. Collaboration holds the key to producing and abiding by community standards, and building and maintaining productive networks, and is by definition the essence of data sharing itself. Time should be invested in establishing and sustaining collaboration with all stakeholders concerned with public health surveillance data sharing.”

    Examples of data collaboratives include H3Africa (a collaboration between NIH and Wellcome Trust) and NHS England’s care.data programme.

  shortDescription: A working paper describing how privately held data sources could
    fill current gaps in the efforts of National Statistics Offices.
  annotation: |-
    This working paper acknowledges the growing body of work on how different types of data (e.g, telecom data, social media, sensors and geospatial data, etc.) can address data gaps relevant to National Statistical Offices (NSOs).

    Four models of public-private interaction for statistics are describe: in-house production of statistics by a data-provider for a national statistics office (NSO), transfer of data-sets to NSOs from private entities, transfer of data to a third party provider to manage the NSO and private entity data, and the outsourcing of NSO functions.

    The paper highlights challenges to public-private partnerships involving data (e.g., technical challenges, data confidentiality, risks, limited incentives for participation), suggests deliberate and highly structured approaches to public-private partnerships involving data require enforceable contracts, emphasizes the trade-off between data specificity and accessibility of such data, and the importance of pricing mechanisms that reflect the capacity and capability of national statistic offices.

    Case studies referenced in the paper include:
    - A mobile network operator’s (MNO Telefonica) in house analysis of call detail records;
    - A third-party data provider and steward of travel statistics (Positium);
    - The Data for Development (D4D) challenge organized by MNO Orange; and
    - Statistics Netherlands use of social media to predict consumer confidence.

  shortDescription: 'A paper highlighting the advantages of third-party organizations
    enabling data sharing between industry and academia to uncover new insights to
    benefit the public good.

'
  annotation: |-
    This paper discusses the concept of a “boundary organization” in relation to industry-academic partnerships driven by data. Boundary organizations perform mediated revealing, allowing firms to disclose their research problems to a broad audience of innovators and simultaneously minimize the risk that this information would be adversely used by competitors.

    The authors identify two especially important challenges for private firms to enter open data or participate in data collaboratives with the academic research community that could be addressed through more involvement from boundary organizations:
    - First is a challenge of maintaining competitive advantage. The authors note that, “the more a firm attempts to align the efforts in an open data research programme with its R&D priorities, the more it will have to reveal about the problems it is addressing within its proprietary R&D.”
    - Second, involves the misalignment of incentives between the private and academic field. Perkmann and Schildt argue that, a firm seeking to build collaborations around its opened data “will have to provide suitable incentives that are aligned with academic scientists’ desire to be rewarded for their work within their respective communities.”

  stepTitle: Determine audience and information sharing approach
  discussion: Some data collaboratives are primarily or exclusively focused on improving
    the data capacity of participating institutions. Others, however, have additional,
    external audiences or user groups. Clearly defining the audience(s) and their
    needs can enable stakeholders to craft an information sharing approach that is
    well-suited to maximizing the usefulness of newly created data-driven offerings.
  questions: "- Who are the intended beneficiaries or user groups for the data collaborative?
    \n- Do the different user groups exist in different sectors?\n- Do the different
    user groups have divergent needs or introduce divergent challenges? \n- Is there
    a particular user group that should be prioritized?\n- What are the communication
    channels through which the intended audiences can best be reached? "

  stepTitle: Select the most promising potential supply-side data providers and identify
    specific incentives for them to participate
  discussion: When and why corporations contribute their data differs according to
    the context in which the data is being requested or shared, the question access
    to their data may answer and the corporate and legal culture of the firm. Different
    corporations also have different views regarding the expected benefits and risks
    from sharing their data. As such, when firms extend themselves and share their
    data they seek to satisfy a variety of motivations.
  questions: "##### What entities are best suited for filling identified data gaps
    and/or expertise?\n##### Why would different actors be motivated to collaborate?\n-
    *Reciprocity*: corporations may share their data with others for mutual benefit,
    especially gaining access to other data sources that may be important to their
    own business decisions. Some corporations may also reciprocate due to a sense
    of “giving back that was taken” from individuals and society-at-large.\n- *Research
    & insights*: opening up their data may generate new answers to particular questions
    providing companies insights that may not have been extracted otherwise. Just
    as with open source, sharing data (and in some cases algorithms) can enable corporations
    to tap into data analytical skills (often free labor) distributed beyond the boundaries
    of their own company. External users may interrogate the data in new ways and
    use the skills and methodologies not readily available in the company. It may
    also create the potential to identify and hire valuable talent that can emerge
    from data. In addition, these insights may enable companies to identify new niches
    for activity and to develop new business models.\n- *Reputation and public relations*:
    sharing data for public good may enhance a firm’s corporate image and reputation,
    potentially attracting new users and customers. It may also offer an opportunity
    to gain (free) media attention and increase visibility among certain decision
    makers and other audiences.\n- Revenue generation: opening up corporate data does
    not always have to be for free. Under some conditions, corporate data may be offered
    for sale, generating extra revenue for firms.\n- *Regulatory compliance*: sharing
    data can also help corporations comply with sectoral regulations and becoming
    more transparent and trusted. In addition, many corporations are generating data
    often for the sole purpose of regulatory compliance. Sharing and using that data
    in a responsible manner (see below regarding some of the risks of opening up data)
    for public and private beneficial ways may leverage more broadly the investment
    made to collect the data for a narrow purpose. \n- *Responsibility and corporate
    philanthropy*: finally, sharing corporate data achieves many of the goals sought
    by traditional corporate social responsibility or philanthropy, where a company
    derives value from socially responsible behavior not just because of the positive
    image such an activity produces, but because opening up data can also improve
    the competitive business environment within which the business operates."

  discussion: Establishing a data collaborative is often less expensive than creating
    the mechanisms to generate and collect data that is already held elsewhere, but
    there are often costs involved – including human capital costs for data scientists
    and stewards. An upfront and realistic assessment of the likely costs of the arrangement

  stepTitle: Data Supply
  discussion: 'In many ways, data collaboratives are means for filling gaps in existing
    institutional data supplies. In order to fill such gaps, organizers should conduct
    an upfront audit of both the existing internal data supply and the potential supply
    of data existing in other sectors. Such an audit can provide insight regarding
    the data relevant to your project, who has it, who needs it, and how it can be
    used to tackle the problem. Data audits can also help inform and prioritize outreach
    to external data holders and ensure that newly accessible datasets are well-positioned
    for filling the most important data gaps. Too often the assumption is that all
    data must be made available when only a few data points are needed. As part of
    the data inventory, other considerations may include assessing the reputation
    and reliability of those who have the data and those who want it in terms of security
    and data responsibility. In and of itself, undertaking the data inventory helps
    to mitigate risk by helping to develop strategies for how to use the data. A more
    detailed analysis by interdisciplinary experts may help to identify technical
    or procedural workarounds for seemingly difficult or expensive tasks. '
  questions: |
    ##### Internal: Conduct due diligence research and a data audit
    - What data currently exists that will be useful in addressing the problem?
    - What are the data gaps that slow progress toward addressing the problem?
    ##### External: Map the potential supply side based on identified gaps
    - Develop a data inventory – what data do you already have?
    - Which entities (whether private, governmental or nongovernmental) possess and could provide the needed data?
  examples: "- [The New York City Business Atlas](http://odimpact.org/case-united-states-new-york-city-business-atlas.html)

  stepTitle: 'Define the problem to be solved '
  discussion: Gaining a clear sense of the problem you are seeking to solve is an
    essential first step in establishing a successful data collaborative. While defining
    the problem space might seem like a straightforward proposition, achieving the
    level of precision needed for a well-targeted data collaborative requires an in-depth
    assessment of the problem space. Zeroing in on the problem can be difficult. To
    pinpoint an actionable problem with a specific data collaboration solution rather
    than a vague issue, requires writing and re-writing a one page Problem Statement.
    The Problem Statement articulates the problem with precision and makes assumptions
    explicit. It asks and answers why the problem has not been solved yet. It might
    also address who is harmed by the existence of the problem and why and what are
    the root causes of the problem. It might take several drafts to strip down to
    a statement of an actionable problem and its causes. But undertaking this exercise
    – especially doing so collaboratively with the participation of the key stakeholders
    involved in the issue – will help to build consensus behind the implementation

  stepTitle: Define ideal type of data collaborative based on supply/demand
  discussion: 'Data collaboratives exist in a number of forms, each of which is better
    positioned for a certain problem or date type. The current field of practice shows
    that there are currently six main types of data collaboratives, the preceding
    steps in this canvas should help to make clear which of the following collaboration
    mechanisms is best-suited for the opportunity at hand.

'
  questions: "Given the insights gained during previous steps, which data collaborative
    type is best suited to the problem at hand?  \n- __Trusted Intermediary__, where
    companies share data with a limited number of known partners. Companies generally
    share data with these entities for data analysis and modeling, as well as other
    value chain activities. \n- __Prizes or Challenge__, in which companies make data
    available to qualified applicants who compete to develop new apps or discover
    innovative uses for the data. Companies typically host these contests in an effort
    to incentivize a wide range of civic hackers, pro-bono data scientists and other
    expert users to find innovative solutions with the available data.\n- __Research
    Partnership__, in which corporations share data with universities and other research
    organizations. Through partnerships with corporate data providers, several research
    organizations are conducting experiments using anonymized and aggregated samples
    of consumer datasets and other sources of data to analyze social trends.\n- __Intelligence
    Products__, where companies share (often aggregated) data that provides general
    insight into market conditions, customer demographic information, or other broad
    trends. \n- __Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)__, which allow developers
    and others to access data for testing, product development, and data analytics.
    By signing a terms of service agreement, companies give access to streams of its
    data in order to build applications.\n- __Corporate Data Cooperatives or Pooling__,
    in which corporations — and other important dataholders such as government agencies — group
    together to create “collaborative databases” with shared data resources. These
    collaborations typically require an organizing partner as well as technical and
    legal frameworks surrounding the use and distribution of the data."
  examples: |-
    - __Trusted Intermediary__: South Africa-based telecom MTN makes anonymized call records available to researchers through a trusted intermediary, Real Impacts Analytics — a data analytics firm that provides guided and predictive analytics solutions through its [Data for Good Program](http://datacollaboratives.org/cases/real-impact-analytics-data-for-good-program.html).
    - __Prizes or Challenges__: In Ivory Coast and Senegal, Orange Telecom hosted a global challenge – the [Orange Telecom Data for Development Challenge](http://datacollaboratives.org/cases/orange-telecom-data-for-development-challenge.html) – that allowed researchers to use anonymized, aggregated data to help solve various development problems, including those related to transportation, health, and agriculture.
    - __Research Partnership__: Yelp shares its data on neighborhood businesses with 30 universities for researchers to build tools and discover meaningful value in the data. Using shared data on Yelp businesses in the San Francisco Bay Area, an academic research team from U.C. Berkeley used a probabilistic model for natural language processing to detect subtopics across a dataset of over 200,000 Yelp business reviews. Their research uncovered correlations between positive ratings and service quality, giving business owners evidence for improving their services.
    - __APIs__: Facebook Open Graph Search allows for consumers and companies to mine social graphs for search query-based data, such as demographic and location data, “likes,” and multimedia. Companies such as Slate and Upworthy have used available data from Open Graph Search to optimize their headlines and increase readership.
    - __Corporate Data Cooperatives or Pooling__: Through its [Accelerating Medicines Partnership](http://datacollaboratives.org/cases/accelerating-medicines-partnership-amp.html), the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) is helping organize data pooling among the world’s largest biopharmaceutical companies in order to identify promising drug and diagnostic targets for Alzheimer’s disease.

    stepTitle: Data Science Expertise and Organizational Competency
    discussion: Cross-sector data sharing requires not only the bringing together
      of diverse datasets, but also collaboration between people and organizations
      with different skills and institutional norms. An upfront understanding of how
      human and institutional capacity and cultures either do or do not mesh can help
      to define optimal roles and responsibilities and identify capacity gaps that
      need to be filled (through additional partnerships or other mechanisms).

    stepNumber: Step 4
    stepTitle: Data Supply
    discussion: 'In many ways, data collaboratives are means for filling gaps in existing
      institutional data supplies. In order to fill such gaps, organizers should conduct
      an upfront audit of both the existing internal data supply and the potential
      supply of data existing in other sectors. Such an audit can provide insight
      regarding the data relevant to your project, who has it, who needs it, and how
      it can be used to tackle the problem. Data audits can also help inform and prioritize
      outreach to external data holders and ensure that newly accessible datasets
      are well-positioned for filling the most important data gaps. Too often the
      assumption is that all data must be made available when only a few data points
      are needed. As part of the data inventory, other considerations may include
      assessing the reputation and reliability of those who have the data and those
      who want it in terms of security and data responsibility. In and of itself,
      undertaking the data inventory helps to mitigate risk by helping to develop
      strategies for how to use the data. A more detailed analysis by interdisciplinary
      experts may help to identify technical or procedural workarounds for seemingly
      difficult or expensive tasks. '
    questions: |
      ##### Internal: Conduct due diligence research and a data audit
      - What data currently exists that will be useful in addressing the problem?
      - What are the data gaps that slow progress toward addressing the problem?
      ##### External: Map the potential supply side based on identified gaps
      - Develop a data inventory – what data do you already have?
      - Which entities (whether private, governmental or nongovernmental) possess and could provide the needed data?
    examples: "- [The New York City Business Atlas](http://odimpact.org/case-united-states-new-york-city-business-atlas.html)
      was developed by the Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics (MODA) by bringing together
      open government data relevant to small businesspeople interested in opening
      physical locations in the city to inform their decisionmaking. Official datasets,
      however, did not provide a sense of the foot traffic in different areas of the
      city. To fill this gap, MODA partnered with Placemeter, a local startup that
      analyzes video imagery to understand pedestrian flows throughout the city.  \n"

  phaseTitle: Implementation
  phaseDescription: 'By stage five, all parties should have a clear understanding
    of how the arrangement will work, the key risks and strategies for addressing
    them, and the processes that will ensure the data collaborative runs as expected.
    At the implementation stage, the data collaborative is launched, but only after
    expectations, roles, timeline and cost questions are answered. As with any product
    launch, the creation of a data collaborative requires thinking about what will
    happen, when, by whom and in what order. To cross the chasm from idea to implementation
    and, for example, to persuade others to take the steps necessary to embark on
    a new plan of action, you must be able to draft an implementation memo that lays
    out the steps of the project from data sharing to use to analysis to evaluation.
    The memo also needs to address the resources that need to be secured for the data
    collaborative to become sustainable. This goes beyond mere financial budgeting
    to include physical, human, data assets and cultural conditions needed to be successful. '

    stepTitle: 'Determine Resources: Cost and Funding Models'
    discussion: Establishing a data collaborative is often less expensive than creating
      the mechanisms to generate and collect data that is already held elsewhere,
      but there are often costs involved – including human capital costs for data
      scientists and stewards. An upfront and realistic assessment of the likely costs
      of the arrangement can inform strategic funding decisions – whether a tiered
      pricing model for a B2C, B2B or B2G data collaborative or seeking support from
      philanthropic and/or governmental grantmakers.

    stepTitle: Select the most promising potential supply-side data providers and
      identify specific incentives for them to participate
    discussion: When and why corporations contribute their data differs according
      to the context in which the data is being requested or shared, the question
      access to their data may answer and the corporate and legal culture of the firm.
      Different corporations also have different views regarding the expected benefits
      and risks from sharing their data. As such, when firms extend themselves and
      share their data they seek to satisfy a variety of motivations.
    questions: "##### What entities are best suited for filling identified data gaps
      and/or expertise?\n##### Why would different actors be motivated to collaborate?\n-
      *Reciprocity*: corporations may share their data with others for mutual benefit,
      especially gaining access to other data sources that may be important to their
      own business decisions. Some corporations may also reciprocate due to a sense
      of “giving back that was taken” from individuals and society-at-large.\n- *Research
      & insights*: opening up their data may generate new answers to particular questions
      providing companies insights that may not have been extracted otherwise. Just
      as with open source, sharing data (and in some cases algorithms) can enable
      corporations to tap into data analytical skills (often free labor) distributed
      beyond the boundaries of their own company. External users may interrogate the
      data in new ways and use the skills and methodologies not readily available
      in the company. It may also create the potential to identify and hire valuable
      talent that can emerge from data. In addition, these insights may enable companies
      to identify new niches for activity and to develop new business models.\n- *Reputation
      and public relations*: sharing data for public good may enhance a firm’s corporate
      image and reputation, potentially attracting new users and customers. It may
      also offer an opportunity to gain (free) media attention and increase visibility
      among certain decision makers and other audiences.\n- Revenue generation: opening
      up corporate data does not always have to be for free. Under some conditions,
      corporate data may be offered for sale, generating extra revenue for firms.\n-
      *Regulatory compliance*: sharing data can also help corporations comply with
      sectoral regulations and becoming more transparent and trusted. In addition,
      many corporations are generating data often for the sole purpose of regulatory
      compliance. Sharing and using that data in a responsible manner (see below regarding
      some of the risks of opening up data) for public and private beneficial ways
      may leverage more broadly the investment made to collect the data for a narrow
      purpose. \n- *Responsibility and corporate philanthropy*: finally, sharing corporate
      data achieves many of the goals sought by traditional corporate social responsibility
      or philanthropy, where a company derives value from socially responsible behavior
      not just because of the positive image such an activity produces, but because
      opening up data can also improve the competitive business environment within
      which the business operates."
