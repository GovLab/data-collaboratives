    type 2 diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosusand.\n\nAll
    AMP partners make the data and analyses they contribute publicly accessible to
    the broad biomedical community through an online portal. An executive committee
    of representatives from the NIH, participating industry leaders, the FDA, and
    non-profit organizations oversees the organization. Individual projects are overseen
    through steering committees for each of the disease areas, each committee containing
    representation from all partners. \n\nThe AMP initiative combines public-private
    expertise and pooled data to reduce the time and cost of developing biomarkers
    for disease treatment. The project attempts to overcome fragmentation in the pharmaceutical
    industry and improve innovation in drug therapy. By combining data the AMP portal
    can find new drug targets and reduce wasteful repetition of testing found when
    companies work in silos."

    Launched in 2008, the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX) allows entrepreneurs in Ethiopia, including small farmers, to access real time reliable price information and consistent quality standards data. The ECX makes information accessible via SMS text messages, an interactive telephone hotline, tickers using electronic displays at specific regional sites, the EXC.com website, and TV, radio, and newspaper dissemination in four languages.

    Before the launch of the ECX in 2008, farmers struggled to find market price information, often received prices far below market value⁠—estimated on average to be just 35–38 percent of export price⁠—and sometimes suffered serious losses when traders reneged on payment. The ECX aims to create transparent quality standards, allowing farmers to increase product quality and thereby the price they obtain. As a result, in the first year and a half of coffee trading, the Exchange saw the volume of highest grade coffee triple.

    Orbital Insights is a data analytics company that provides products to both private businesses and nonprofit entities to the end of enabling data-driven decision making. The organization regularly works with instiutions such as the World Bank in an initiative "testing the effectiveness of machine-analyzed satellite images for humanitarian data collection through deep learning artificial intelligence." It also works with the Global Forest Watch to promote its forest conservation research.

    The combination of Orbital’s satellite imagery and artificial intelligence capabilities can be used in several ways. The company showed, for instance, that artificial intelligence analyzing satellite imagery to count cars in a retailer’s parking lot “can be more accurate than U.S. census data at predicting the retailer’s quarterly earnings.”

    the results and data from their experiments universally accessible. This open
    data, collected as often as every 15 minutes, includes information on water run-off
    levels, soil moisture, meteorological data and soil nutrients and is expected
    to run for decades.\n\nRothamsted Research collaborates with Tessella, a data
    consultancy, to ensure that the collection and distribution of the data is done
    responsibly. The data is scrutinized by a team of experts, and a complex data
    management system makes sure the data is efficiently shared and uploaded on a
    web platform for the public to access. Andrew Bowen from Tessella explained to
    BBC, \"The back-end database was relatively complex just in terms of collecting,
    managing and organizing the data. This presented another challenge in terms of
    how we presented this in an attractive, acceptable and accessible way [to end-users].\"
    \ \n\nThe project is a continuation of the Godan Initiative, of which Rothamsted
    Archive is a part. The initiative aims to make agricultural data available to
    the global scientific community in order to support agricultural innovation. Rothamsted,
    which houses some of the oldest and most comprehensive agricultural data, is an
    important partner in furthering this goal. "

    Launched by Singapore's GovTech and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) with a number of private and non-governmental organizations lending support, Beeline acts as a matching service between people using the Beeline app and the city's numerous private bus services. Beeline collects consolidated bus transportation and user data collected via the Beeline app, which can then represent "community demand" information. In doing so Beeline crowdsources transportation insights directly from the passengers using the service. These "user suggested routes" are created when there is a large enough demand for this route.

    Beeline attempts to close the gap between commuters' needs and the services offered by private bus companies by providing a feedback mechanism within the app. Its goal is to create a more responsive and efficient transport system by "crowdsourcing" bus services. The service has also led to the creation of [GrabShuttle](https://www.grab.com/sg/shuttle/) in 2017, a fixed-route shuttle service that allows users to track the buses in real-time.

This included "coastal blue, yellow, red-edge and NIR2" data. The collaborative marked the first time the scientific community had access to high resolution images with 8 spectral bands. This allowed unprecedented information to be gleaned useful in Land Use Land Cover Analysis, Environmental Mapping and Monitoring, and Coastal Habitat Mapping.

    Since the original website advertising this challenge has since been taken down, it is unclear what the specifications regarding data access for competitors involved. However, chosen contestants were given the multispectral imaging and a few weeks to test and evaluate their algorithms on DigitalGlobe data.

    flu conditions with a 29 percent increase in accuracy. \n\nIn 2013, the CDC, having
    taken notice of this increased interest in social media flu prediction, organized
    and hosted its first “Predict the Flu Season” challenge. This challenge focused
    the nine participating teams of researchers on predicting various milestones of
    the influenza season—e.g., start, duration and peak—which would be the most useful
    to public health prevention efforts.\n\nThe model developed by the researchers
    at Johns Hopkins demonstrates the promise and potential of the effective use of
    social media data to inform flu prediction. Their influenza model could predict
    the virus’s future activity one to two weeks before the CDC data alone with the

    On Sunday, September 24th, 2017, we will reconvene our community to deepen our mutual understanding. The theme for this year’s edition will be “__With Great Data comes Great Responsibility__,” or how data science can be applied to solve public interest problems without losing its soul.

    The data revolution has enabled businesses to provide better service, at lower cost, and to more customers, at a scale and rate of change not seen since the industrial revolution. In contrast to the corporate sector, the public and non-profit sectors have seen significantly less application of data science methods.

    Since 2014, Bloomberg has hosted the annual D4GX conference on the application of data science to solve problems for the social good. This forum enables data scientists from academia, industry and public sector actors from government and NGOs to build relationships, share insights and progress, and encourages them to work together on applying modern machine learning and data science methods to challenges in the public and non-profit sectors.

  stepTitle: 'Define the problem to be solved '
  discussion: Gaining a clear sense of the problem you are seeking to solve is an
    essential first step in establishing a successful data collaborative. While defining
    the problem space might seem like a straightforward proposition, achieving the
    level of precision needed for a well-targeted data collaborative requires an in-depth
    assessment of the problem space. Zeroing in on the problem can be difficult. To
    pinpoint an actionable problem with a specific data collaboration solution rather
    than a vague issue, requires writing and re-writing a one page Problem Statement.
    The Problem Statement articulates the problem with precision and makes assumptions
    explicit. It asks and answers why the problem has not been solved yet. It might
    also address who is harmed by the existence of the problem and why and what are
    the root causes of the problem. It might take several drafts to strip down to
    a statement of an actionable problem and its causes. But undertaking this exercise
    – especially doing so collaboratively with the participation of the key stakeholders
    involved in the issue – will help to build consensus behind the implementation
    of the project.
  questions: "- Describe issue to be addressed\n- Identify the beneficiaries\n- Explain
    why now \n- Articulate why it matters\n- Note any assumptions\n- Examine any counterarguments

  stepNumber: Step 2
  stepTitle: Define the value proposition of the data collaborative
  discussion: Research and practice in data collaboratives point to a number of societal
    benefits arising from the cross-sector sharing of data. After clearly defining
    the problem that a data collaborative will serve to address, organizers should
    look to gain specificity on the specific benefit a data collaborative could offer.
    Without assessing the value of the data collaborative, tradeoffs cannot later
    be measured. To understand whether the use of a corporate data is worthwhile despite
    the risks involved, and to find the proper steps to take that mitigate risk, it
    is important to evaluate the context for the use of the data. This might involve
    an assessment of the urgency of having access to the data. Is there a disaster
    relief component or other time sensitivity? If it is hard to define the problem
    or hard to define the value, it will be impossible to evaluate the success of
    any data project. To justify the risks and the potential liability that arises
    from using and analyzing corporate data requires having a clearly articulated
    benefit that can be measured.
  questions: |-
    What is the intended societal benefit of the data collaborative?
    - Situational awareness and response?
    - Public service design and delivery?
    - Knowledge creation and transfer?
    - Prediction and forecasting?
    - Impact assessment and evaluation?

  stepTitle: Data Science Expertise and Organizational Competency
  discussion: Cross-sector data sharing requires not only the bringing together of
    diverse datasets, but also collaboration between people and organizations with
    different skills and institutional norms. An upfront understanding of how human
    and institutional capacity and cultures either do or do not mesh can help to define
    optimal roles and responsibilities and identify capacity gaps that need to be
    filled (through additional partnerships or other mechanisms).
  questions: "##### Internal\n- Evaluate and review internal capacity \n- Build high-level
    internal support\n- Identify internal data literacy and human capital \n- Collect
    and share examples of how other organizations have leveraged data\n##### External
    \n- Which entities could provide additional competencies (data science and otherwise)?\n"

  stepNumber: Step 4
  stepTitle: Data Supply
  discussion: 'In many ways, data collaboratives are means for filling gaps in existing
    institutional data supplies. In order to fill such gaps, organizers should conduct
    an upfront audit of both the existing internal data supply and the potential supply
    of data existing in other sectors. Such an audit can provide insight regarding
    the data relevant to your project, who has it, who needs it, and how it can be
    used to tackle the problem. Data audits can also help inform and prioritize outreach
    to external data holders and ensure that newly accessible datasets are well-positioned
    for filling the most important data gaps. Too often the assumption is that all
    data must be made available when only a few data points are needed. As part of
    the data inventory, other considerations may include assessing the reputation
    and reliability of those who have the data and those who want it in terms of security
    and data responsibility. In and of itself, undertaking the data inventory helps
    to mitigate risk by helping to develop strategies for how to use the data. A more
    detailed analysis by interdisciplinary experts may help to identify technical
    or procedural workarounds for seemingly difficult or expensive tasks. '
  questions: |
    ##### Internal: Conduct due diligence research and a data audit
    - What data currently exists that will be useful in addressing the problem?
    - What are the data gaps that slow progress toward addressing the problem?
    ##### External: Map the potential supply side based on identified gaps

    was developed by the Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics (MODA) by bringing together
    open government data relevant to small businesspeople interested in opening physical
    locations in the city to inform their decisionmaking. Official datasets, however,
    did not provide a sense of the foot traffic in different areas of the city. To
    fill this gap, MODA partnered with Placemeter, a local startup that analyzes video
    imagery to understand pedestrian flows throughout the city.  \n"

  stepTitle: Select the most promising potential supply-side data providers and identify
    specific incentives for them to participate
  discussion: When and why corporations contribute their data differs according to
    the context in which the data is being requested or shared, the question access
    to their data may answer and the corporate and legal culture of the firm. Different
    corporations also have different views regarding the expected benefits and risks
    from sharing their data. As such, when firms extend themselves and share their
    data they seek to satisfy a variety of motivations.
  questions: "##### What entities are best suited for filling identified data gaps
    and/or expertise?\n##### Why would different actors be motivated to collaborate?\n-
    *Reciprocity*: corporations may share their data with others for mutual benefit,
    especially gaining access to other data sources that may be important to their
    own business decisions. Some corporations may also reciprocate due to a sense
    of “giving back that was taken” from individuals and society-at-large.\n- *Research
    & insights*: opening up their data may generate new answers to particular questions
    providing companies insights that may not have been extracted otherwise. Just
    as with open source, sharing data (and in some cases algorithms) can enable corporations
    to tap into data analytical skills (often free labor) distributed beyond the boundaries
    of their own company. External users may interrogate the data in new ways and
    use the skills and methodologies not readily available in the company. It may
    also create the potential to identify and hire valuable talent that can emerge
    from data. In addition, these insights may enable companies to identify new niches
    for activity and to develop new business models.\n- *Reputation and public relations*:
    sharing data for public good may enhance a firm’s corporate image and reputation,
    potentially attracting new users and customers. It may also offer an opportunity
    to gain (free) media attention and increase visibility among certain decision
    makers and other audiences.\n- Revenue generation: opening up corporate data does
    not always have to be for free. Under some conditions, corporate data may be offered
    for sale, generating extra revenue for firms.\n- *Regulatory compliance*: sharing
    data can also help corporations comply with sectoral regulations and becoming
    more transparent and trusted. In addition, many corporations are generating data
    often for the sole purpose of regulatory compliance. Sharing and using that data
    in a responsible manner (see below regarding some of the risks of opening up data)
    for public and private beneficial ways may leverage more broadly the investment
    made to collect the data for a narrow purpose. \n- *Responsibility and corporate
    philanthropy*: finally, sharing corporate data achieves many of the goals sought
    by traditional corporate social responsibility or philanthropy, where a company
    derives value from socially responsible behavior not just because of the positive
    image such an activity produces, but because opening up data can also improve
    the competitive business environment within which the business operates."

  discussion: 'Data collaboratives exist in a number of forms, each of which is better
    positioned for a certain problem or date type. The current field of practice shows
    that there are currently six main types of data collaboratives, the preceding
    steps in this canvas should help to make clear which of the following collaboration
    mechanisms is best-suited for the opportunity at hand.

    '
  questions: "Given the insights gained during previous steps, which data collaborative
    type is best suited to the problem at hand?  \n- __Trusted Intermediary__, where
    companies share data with a limited number of known partners. Companies generally
    share data with these entities for data analysis and modeling, as well as other
    value chain activities. \n- __Prizes or Challenge__, in which companies make data
    available to qualified applicants who compete to develop new apps or discover
    innovative uses for the data. Companies typically host these contests in an effort
    to incentivize a wide range of civic hackers, pro-bono data scientists and other
    expert users to find innovative solutions with the available data.\n- __Research
    Partnership__, in which corporations share data with universities and other research
    organizations. Through partnerships with corporate data providers, several research
    organizations are conducting experiments using anonymized and aggregated samples
    of consumer datasets and other sources of data to analyze social trends.\n- __Intelligence
    Products__, where companies share (often aggregated) data that provides general
    insight into market conditions, customer demographic information, or other broad
    trends. \n- __Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)__, which allow developers
    and others to access data for testing, product development, and data analytics.
    By signing a terms of service agreement, companies give access to streams of its
    data in order to build applications.\n- __Corporate Data Cooperatives or Pooling__,
    in which corporations — and other important dataholders such as government agencies — group
    together to create “collaborative databases” with shared data resources. These
    collaborations typically require an organizing partner as well as technical and
    legal frameworks surrounding the use and distribution of the data."

    - __Trusted Intermediary__: South Africa-based telecom MTN makes anonymized call records available to researchers through a trusted intermediary, Real Impacts Analytics — a data analytics firm that provides guided and predictive analytics solutions through its [Data for Good Program](http://datacollaboratives.org/cases/real-impact-analytics-data-for-good-program.html).
    - __Prizes or Challenges__: In Ivory Coast and Senegal, Orange Telecom hosted a global challenge – the [Orange Telecom Data for Development Challenge](http://datacollaboratives.org/cases/orange-telecom-data-for-development-challenge.html) – that allowed researchers to use anonymized, aggregated data to help solve various development problems, including those related to transportation, health, and agriculture.
    - __Research Partnership__: Yelp shares its data on neighborhood businesses with 30 universities for researchers to build tools and discover meaningful value in the data. Using shared data on Yelp businesses in the San Francisco Bay Area, an academic research team from U.C. Berkeley used a probabilistic model for natural language processing to detect subtopics across a dataset of over 200,000 Yelp business reviews. Their research uncovered correlations between positive ratings and service quality, giving business owners evidence for improving their services.
    - __APIs__: Facebook Open Graph Search allows for consumers and companies to mine social graphs for search query-based data, such as demographic and location data, “likes,” and multimedia. Companies such as Slate and Upworthy have used available data from Open Graph Search to optimize their headlines and increase readership.
    - __Corporate Data Cooperatives or Pooling__: Through its [Accelerating Medicines Partnership](http://datacollaboratives.org/cases/accelerating-medicines-partnership-amp.html), the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) is helping organize data pooling among the world’s largest biopharmaceutical companies in order to identify promising drug and diagnostic targets for Alzheimer’s disease.

  stepTitle: Assess major risks, ethical concerns and potential challenges
  discussion: The collection, processing, sharing, analysis and use of data introduce
    a number of risks and challenges for stakeholders involved in data collaboratives.
    Rather than seeking to mitigate the realized harms arising from those risks after
    the fact, stakeholders should seek to understand the risks at every stage of the
    data lifecycle in order to develop well-targeted strategies for mitigating them.
  questions: "##### Understand risks across the data lifecycle (with particular focus
    on the sharing and use stages)\n- **Collection**\n    - Collection of inaccurate
    or “dirty” data\n    - Unauthorized data collection\n    - Incomplete, non-representative
    sampling\n- **Analysis & Processing**\n    - Insufficient, outdated, or inflexible
    security provisions\n    - Aggregation/correlation of incomparable datasets\n
    \   - Lack of academic rigor\n    - Each of the above can heavily influence outcome
    of study or misrepresent the data\n- **Sharing**\n    - Incompatible cultural
    or institutional norms or expectations\n    - Lack of stewardship on both ends
    to ensure responsible sharing of personally identifiable information as it travels
    across cases and sectors\n    - Improper or unauthorized access to shared data\n
    \   - Conflicting legal jurisdictions and different levels of security\n- **Use**\n
    \   - Controversial or incongruous data usage\n    - Misinterpretation of data\n
    \   - Possible re-identification of individuals\n    - Decisional interference\n\n#####
    What are the relevant legal, political and cultural concerns\n- Ensuring proprietary
    data isn’t subject to Freedom of Information laws \n- Does the data collaborative
    (or the partner) raise any sensitive political concerns?\n- Does the collaboration
    comport with the cultural (and societal) expectations of all parties?\n\n#####
    List potential unintended consequences\n- Profiling and Discrimination\n- Entrenching
    Existing Biases and Power Dynamics\n\n##### Anticipate potential harms to corporations\n-
    Criminal or civil legal investigations and/or regulatory fines;\n- Loss of regulatory
    licenses, standards, certifications;\n- Reputational and industrial damages –
    impacting competitive positioning and advantage; \n    - share price and/or cost
    of capital;\n    - customer attrition rates;\n    - employee recruitment, productivity
    and retention\n- Overall increase in operating expenses \n- Anticipate potential
    operational challenges"

    organizers can develop strategies and responsibility frameworks to help mitigate
    those risks before they have real-world consequences.
  questions: "- Prioritize risks according to their likelihood of becoming reality
    and the severity of the harms they would create. \n- Consider alternative mechanisms
    or datasets that would not introduce the same level of risk.\n- Study how similar
    uses of data by other entities were either successful or unsuccessful in mitigating

  stepTitle: Establish a Governance Structure
  discussion: Establishing a data collaborative requires a number of upfront efforts
    across stakeholder groups. The many decisions to be made and responsibilities
    present in such an arrangement, however, do not end at the implementation stage.
    An agreed upon governance structure for the lifespan of the data collaborative
    can help to ensure that the processes for making important decisions – whether,
    for example, related to new uses for datasets or unanticipated risks coming into
    view – are clearly defined and understood by all parties. In addition, for the
    effort to be seen as legitimate, the process of developing data collaborative
    policies needs to be collaboratively engaging and consulting with a variety of
    groups, including both private sector and impacted citizens. Such consultation
    is also part of identifying potential benefits and these steps can be brought
    together even though we distinguish between them here.
  questions: "- What will the data collaborative’s decision-making process and hierarchy
    be? \n- How can stakeholders create feedback loops to ensure that progress isn’t
    made in isolation?\n- How will concerns be acted upon? \n- What will the process
    be for taking the data collaborative in a new direction or abandoning it should
    it prove innefective?"

    With this upfront knowledge, the operational aspects of an effective data collaborative
    can be defined – with the understanding that specifics can and should be iterated
    upon as needed going forward.
  questions: "- What are the expectations of each of the entities, and how does the
    initiative align with the business (or, if relevant, philanthropic) mission of
    the participating private sector entity? \n- What is the management structure
    for the data collaborative? Who is responsible for stewarding the process?\n-
    Who are the champions in each participating entity? \n- What skills are required
    within the governing institution?\n- What information or data will be made open

  stepTitle: 'Determine Resources: Cost and Funding Models'
  discussion: Establishing a data collaborative is often less expensive than creating
    the mechanisms to generate and collect data that is already held elsewhere, but
    there are often costs involved – including human capital costs for data scientists
    and stewards. An upfront and realistic assessment of the likely costs of the arrangement
    can inform strategic funding decisions – whether a tiered pricing model for a
    B2C, B2B or B2G data collaborative or seeking support from philanthropic and/or
    governmental grantmakers.
  questions: "- Determine cost implications \n- Identify funding partners/models"

  stepTitle: Develop a communications strategy
  discussion: Especially for data collaboratives where corporate data providers were
    incentivized to participate based on reputational benefits, communicating the
    objectives and (intended) impacts of the arrangement to the public can be important.
    In many cases, a high level of specificity in public communications may not be
    desirable, but promoting the existence of the data collaborative can spur interest
    and engagement among target audiences (including funders).
  questions: "- What are the key messages that should be communicated to the public

    external audiences or user groups. Clearly defining the audience(s) and their
    needs can enable stakeholders to craft an information sharing approach that is
    well-suited to maximizing the usefulness of newly created data-driven offerings.
  questions: "- Who are the intended beneficiaries or user groups for the data collaborative?
    \n- Do the different user groups exist in different sectors?\n- Do the different

    discussion: Gaining a clear sense of the problem you are seeking to solve is an
      essential first step in establishing a successful data collaborative. While
      defining the problem space might seem like a straightforward proposition, achieving
      the level of precision needed for a well-targeted data collaborative requires
      an in-depth assessment of the problem space. Zeroing in on the problem can be
      difficult. To pinpoint an actionable problem with a specific data collaboration
      solution rather than a vague issue, requires writing and re-writing a one page
      Problem Statement. The Problem Statement articulates the problem with precision
      and makes assumptions explicit. It asks and answers why the problem has not
      been solved yet. It might also address who is harmed by the existence of the
      problem and why and what are the root causes of the problem. It might take several
      drafts to strip down to a statement of an actionable problem and its causes.
      But undertaking this exercise – especially doing so collaboratively with the
      participation of the key stakeholders involved in the issue – will help to build
      consensus behind the implementation of the project.

      societal benefits arising from the cross-sector sharing of data. After clearly
      defining the problem that a data collaborative will serve to address, organizers
      should look to gain specificity on the specific benefit a data collaborative
      could offer. Without assessing the value of the data collaborative, tradeoffs
      cannot later be measured. To understand whether the use of a corporate data
      is worthwhile despite the risks involved, and to find the proper steps to take
      that mitigate risk, it is important to evaluate the context for the use of the
      data. This might involve an assessment of the urgency of having access to the
      data. Is there a disaster relief component or other time sensitivity? If it
      is hard to define the problem or hard to define the value, it will be impossible
      to evaluate the success of any data project. To justify the risks and the potential
      liability that arises from using and analyzing corporate data requires having
      a clearly articulated benefit that can be measured.
    questions: |-
      What is the intended societal benefit of the data collaborative?
      - Situational awareness and response?
      - Public service design and delivery?
      - Knowledge creation and transfer?
      - Prediction and forecasting?
      - Impact assessment and evaluation?

      human and institutional capacity and cultures either do or do not mesh can help
      to define optimal roles and responsibilities and identify capacity gaps that
      need to be filled (through additional partnerships or other mechanisms).

    stepTitle: Data Supply
    discussion: 'In many ways, data collaboratives are means for filling gaps in existing
      institutional data supplies. In order to fill such gaps, organizers should conduct
      an upfront audit of both the existing internal data supply and the potential
      supply of data existing in other sectors. Such an audit can provide insight
      regarding the data relevant to your project, who has it, who needs it, and how
      it can be used to tackle the problem. Data audits can also help inform and prioritize
      outreach to external data holders and ensure that newly accessible datasets
      are well-positioned for filling the most important data gaps. Too often the
      assumption is that all data must be made available when only a few data points
      are needed. As part of the data inventory, other considerations may include
      assessing the reputation and reliability of those who have the data and those
      who want it in terms of security and data responsibility. In and of itself,
      undertaking the data inventory helps to mitigate risk by helping to develop
      strategies for how to use the data. A more detailed analysis by interdisciplinary
      experts may help to identify technical or procedural workarounds for seemingly
      difficult or expensive tasks. '
    questions: |
      ##### Internal: Conduct due diligence research and a data audit
      - What data currently exists that will be useful in addressing the problem?
      - What are the data gaps that slow progress toward addressing the problem?
      ##### External: Map the potential supply side based on identified gaps
      - Develop a data inventory – what data do you already have?
      - Which entities (whether private, governmental or nongovernmental) possess and could provide the needed data?

    discussion: When and why corporations contribute their data differs according
      to the context in which the data is being requested or shared, the question
      access to their data may answer and the corporate and legal culture of the firm.
      Different corporations also have different views regarding the expected benefits
      and risks from sharing their data. As such, when firms extend themselves and
      share their data they seek to satisfy a variety of motivations.
    questions: "##### What entities are best suited for filling identified data gaps
      and/or expertise?\n##### Why would different actors be motivated to collaborate?\n-
      *Reciprocity*: corporations may share their data with others for mutual benefit,
      especially gaining access to other data sources that may be important to their
      own business decisions. Some corporations may also reciprocate due to a sense
      of “giving back that was taken” from individuals and society-at-large.\n- *Research
      & insights*: opening up their data may generate new answers to particular questions
      providing companies insights that may not have been extracted otherwise. Just
      as with open source, sharing data (and in some cases algorithms) can enable
      corporations to tap into data analytical skills (often free labor) distributed
      beyond the boundaries of their own company. External users may interrogate the
      data in new ways and use the skills and methodologies not readily available
      in the company. It may also create the potential to identify and hire valuable
      talent that can emerge from data. In addition, these insights may enable companies
      to identify new niches for activity and to develop new business models.\n- *Reputation
      and public relations*: sharing data for public good may enhance a firm’s corporate
      image and reputation, potentially attracting new users and customers. It may
      also offer an opportunity to gain (free) media attention and increase visibility
      among certain decision makers and other audiences.\n- Revenue generation: opening
      up corporate data does not always have to be for free. Under some conditions,
      corporate data may be offered for sale, generating extra revenue for firms.\n-
      *Regulatory compliance*: sharing data can also help corporations comply with
      sectoral regulations and becoming more transparent and trusted. In addition,
      many corporations are generating data often for the sole purpose of regulatory
      compliance. Sharing and using that data in a responsible manner (see below regarding
      some of the risks of opening up data) for public and private beneficial ways
      may leverage more broadly the investment made to collect the data for a narrow
      purpose. \n- *Responsibility and corporate philanthropy*: finally, sharing corporate
      data achieves many of the goals sought by traditional corporate social responsibility
      or philanthropy, where a company derives value from socially responsible behavior
      not just because of the positive image such an activity produces, but because
      opening up data can also improve the competitive business environment within
      which the business operates."

    discussion: 'Data collaboratives exist in a number of forms, each of which is
      better positioned for a certain problem or date type. The current field of practice
      shows that there are currently six main types of data collaboratives, the preceding
      steps in this canvas should help to make clear which of the following collaboration
      mechanisms is best-suited for the opportunity at hand.

      '
    questions: "Given the insights gained during previous steps, which data collaborative
      type is best suited to the problem at hand?  \n- __Trusted Intermediary__, where
      companies share data with a limited number of known partners. Companies generally
      share data with these entities for data analysis and modeling, as well as other
      value chain activities. \n- __Prizes or Challenge__, in which companies make
      data available to qualified applicants who compete to develop new apps or discover
      innovative uses for the data. Companies typically host these contests in an
      effort to incentivize a wide range of civic hackers, pro-bono data scientists
      and other expert users to find innovative solutions with the available data.\n-
      __Research Partnership__, in which corporations share data with universities
      and other research organizations. Through partnerships with corporate data providers,
      several research organizations are conducting experiments using anonymized and
      aggregated samples of consumer datasets and other sources of data to analyze
      social trends.\n- __Intelligence Products__, where companies share (often aggregated)
      data that provides general insight into market conditions, customer demographic
      information, or other broad trends. \n- __Application Programming Interfaces
      (APIs)__, which allow developers and others to access data for testing, product
      development, and data analytics. By signing a terms of service agreement, companies
      give access to streams of its data in order to build applications.\n- __Corporate
      Data Cooperatives or Pooling__, in which corporations — and other important
      dataholders such as government agencies — group together to create “collaborative
      databases” with shared data resources. These collaborations typically require
      an organizing partner as well as technical and legal frameworks surrounding
      the use and distribution of the data."
    examples: |-
      - __Trusted Intermediary__: South Africa-based telecom MTN makes anonymized call records available to researchers through a trusted intermediary, Real Impacts Analytics — a data analytics firm that provides guided and predictive analytics solutions through its [Data for Good Program](http://datacollaboratives.org/cases/real-impact-analytics-data-for-good-program.html).
      - __Prizes or Challenges__: In Ivory Coast and Senegal, Orange Telecom hosted a global challenge – the [Orange Telecom Data for Development Challenge](http://datacollaboratives.org/cases/orange-telecom-data-for-development-challenge.html) – that allowed researchers to use anonymized, aggregated data to help solve various development problems, including those related to transportation, health, and agriculture.
      - __Research Partnership__: Yelp shares its data on neighborhood businesses with 30 universities for researchers to build tools and discover meaningful value in the data. Using shared data on Yelp businesses in the San Francisco Bay Area, an academic research team from U.C. Berkeley used a probabilistic model for natural language processing to detect subtopics across a dataset of over 200,000 Yelp business reviews. Their research uncovered correlations between positive ratings and service quality, giving business owners evidence for improving their services.
      - __APIs__: Facebook Open Graph Search allows for consumers and companies to mine social graphs for search query-based data, such as demographic and location data, “likes,” and multimedia. Companies such as Slate and Upworthy have used available data from Open Graph Search to optimize their headlines and increase readership.
      - __Corporate Data Cooperatives or Pooling__: Through its [Accelerating Medicines Partnership](http://datacollaboratives.org/cases/accelerating-medicines-partnership-amp.html), the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) is helping organize data pooling among the world’s largest biopharmaceutical companies in order to identify promising drug and diagnostic targets for Alzheimer’s disease.

    discussion: The collection, processing, sharing, analysis and use of data introduce
      a number of risks and challenges for stakeholders involved in data collaboratives.
      Rather than seeking to mitigate the realized harms arising from those risks
      after the fact, stakeholders should seek to understand the risks at every stage
      of the data lifecycle in order to develop well-targeted strategies for mitigating
      them.

      focus on the sharing and use stages)\n- **Collection**\n    - Collection of
      inaccurate or “dirty” data\n    - Unauthorized data collection\n    - Incomplete,

      \   - Decisional interference\n\n##### What are the relevant legal, political
      and cultural concerns\n- Ensuring proprietary data isn’t subject to Freedom
      of Information laws \n- Does the data collaborative (or the partner) raise any
      sensitive political concerns?\n- Does the collaboration comport with the cultural
      (and societal) expectations of all parties?\n\n##### List potential unintended
      consequences\n- Profiling and Discrimination\n- Entrenching Existing Biases
      and Power Dynamics\n\n##### Anticipate potential harms to corporations\n- Criminal
      or civil legal investigations and/or regulatory fines;\n- Loss of regulatory
      licenses, standards, certifications;\n- Reputational and industrial damages
      – impacting competitive positioning and advantage; \n    - share price and/or
      cost of capital;\n    - customer attrition rates;\n    - employee recruitment,
      productivity and retention\n- Overall increase in operating expenses \n- Anticipate
      potential operational challenges"

    discussion: Establishing a data collaborative requires a number of upfront efforts

      present in such an arrangement, however, do not end at the implementation stage.
      An agreed upon governance structure for the lifespan of the data collaborative
      can help to ensure that the processes for making important decisions – whether,
      for example, related to new uses for datasets or unanticipated risks coming
      into view – are clearly defined and understood by all parties. In addition,
      for the effort to be seen as legitimate, the process of developing data collaborative
      policies needs to be collaboratively engaging and consulting with a variety
      of groups, including both private sector and impacted citizens. Such consultation
      is also part of identifying potential benefits and these steps can be brought
      together even though we distinguish between them here.
    questions: "- What will the data collaborative’s decision-making process and hierarchy
      be? \n- How can stakeholders create feedback loops to ensure that progress isn’t
      made in isolation?\n- How will concerns be acted upon? \n- What will the process
      be for taking the data collaborative in a new direction or abandoning it should
      it prove innefective?"

    At the implementation stage, the data collaborative is launched, but only after
    expectations, roles, timeline and cost questions are answered. As with any product
    launch, the creation of a data collaborative requires thinking about what will
    happen, when, by whom and in what order. To cross the chasm from idea to implementation
    and, for example, to persuade others to take the steps necessary to embark on
    a new plan of action, you must be able to draft an implementation memo that lays
    out the steps of the project from data sharing to use to analysis to evaluation.
    The memo also needs to address the resources that need to be secured for the data
    collaborative to become sustainable. This goes beyond mere financial budgeting
    to include physical, human, data assets and cultural conditions needed to be successful. '

      specifics of data-sharing process
    discussion: Upon completing the preceding steps, stakeholders in the data collaborative
      should possess a clear understanding of how the arrangement can be put into
      practice. With this upfront knowledge, the operational aspects of an effective
      data collaborative can be defined – with the understanding that specifics can
      and should be iterated upon as needed going forward.
    questions: "- What are the expectations of each of the entities, and how does
      the initiative align with the business (or, if relevant, philanthropic) mission
      of the participating private sector entity? \n- What is the management structure
      for the data collaborative? Who is responsible for stewarding the process?\n-
      Who are the champions in each participating entity? \n- What skills are required
      within the governing institution?\n- What information or data will be made open
      to the public\n- Other partners that need to be engaged?"

    stepTitle: 'Determine Resources: Cost and Funding Models'
    discussion: Establishing a data collaborative is often less expensive than creating
      the mechanisms to generate and collect data that is already held elsewhere,
      but there are often costs involved – including human capital costs for data
      scientists and stewards. An upfront and realistic assessment of the likely costs
      of the arrangement can inform strategic funding decisions – whether a tiered
      pricing model for a B2C, B2B or B2G data collaborative or seeking support from
      philanthropic and/or governmental grantmakers.
    questions: "- Determine cost implications \n- Identify funding partners/models"

  shortDescription: A case study examining the opening of private data by Dutch energy
    network administrator Liander.
  annotation: |
    This research has developed a monitoring framework to assess the effects of open (private) data using a case study of a Dutch energy network administrator Liander.

    Focusing on the potential impacts of open private energy data – beyond ‘smart disclosure’ where citizens are given information only about their own energy usage – the authors identify three attainable strategic goals:
    - Continuously optimize performance on services, security of supply, and costs;
    - Improve management of energy flows and insight into energy consumption;
    - Help customers save energy and switch over to renewable energy sources.

    The authors propose a seven-step framework for assessing the impacts of Liander data, in particular, and open private data more generally:
    - Develop a performance framework to describe what the program is about, description of the organization’s mission and strategic goals;
    - Identify the most important elements, or key performance areas which are most critical to understanding and assessing your program’s success;
    - Select the most appropriate performance measures;
    - Determine the gaps between what information you need and what is available;
    - Develop and implement a measurement strategy to address the gaps;
    - Develop a performance report which highlights what you have accomplished and what you have learned;
    - Learn from your experiences and refine your approach as required.

    While the authors note that the true impacts of this open private data will likely not come into view in the short term, they argue that, “Liander has successfully demonstrated that private energy companies can release open data, and has successfully championed the other Dutch network administrators to follow suit.”

    The paper presents a research study conducted on the basis of the mobile calls records shared with researchers in the framework of the Data for Development Challenge by the mobile operator Orange.

    The study discusses the data analysis approach in relation to developing a situation of Ebola diffusion built around “the interactions of multi-scale models, including viral loads (at the cellular level), disease progression (at the individual person level), disease propagation (at the workplace and family level), societal changes in migration and travel movements (at the population level), and mitigating interventions (at the abstract government policy level).”

    The authors argue that the use of their population, mobility, and simulation models provide more accurate simulation details in comparison to high-level analytical predictions and that the D4D mobile datasets provide high-resolution information useful for modeling developing regions and hard to reach locations.

    at the International Data Responsibility Conference focused on identifying emerging
    practices, opportunities and challenges confronting data collaboratives.\n\nThe
    authors list a number of privately held data sources that could create positive
    public impacts if made more accessible in a collaborative manner, including:\n-
    Data for early warning systems to help mitigate the effects of natural disasters;\n-
    Data to help understand human behavior as it relates to nutrition and livelihoods
    in developing countries;\n- Data to monitor compliance with weapons treaties;\n-
    Data to more accurately measure progress related to the UN Sustainable Development
    Goals.\n \nTo the end of identifying and expanding on emerging practice in the
    space, the authors describe a number of current data collaborative experiments,
    including:\n- __Trusted Intermediaries__: Statistics Netherlands partnered with
    Vodafone to analyze mobile call data records in order to better understand mobility
    patterns and inform urban planning.\n- __Prizes and Challenges__: Orange Telecom,
    which has been a leader in this type of Data Collaboration, provided several examples
    of the company’s initiatives, such as the use of call data records to track the
    spread of malaria as well as their experience with Challenge 4 Development.\n-
    __Research partnerships__: The Data for Climate Action project is an ongoing large-scale
    initiative incentivizing companies to share their data to help researchers answer
    particular scientific questions related to climate change and adaptation.\n- __Sharing
    intelligence products__: JPMorgan Chase shares macro economic insights they gained
    leveraging their data through the newly established JPMorgan Chase Institute.\n\nIn
    order to capitalize on the opportunities provided by data collaboratives, a number
    of needs were identified:\n- A responsible data framework;\n- Increased insight

    data – could improve development policy.
  annotation: |-
    This journal article describes how privately held data – namely “digital traces” of consumer activity – “are becoming seen by policymakers and researchers as a potential solution to the lack of reliable statistical data on lower-income countries."

    They focus especially on three categories of data collaborative use cases:
    - Mobile data as a predictive tool for issues such as human mobility and economic activity;
    - Use of mobile data to inform humanitarian response to crises; and
    - Use of born-digital web data as a tool for predicting economic trends, and the implications these have for LMICs.

    They note, however, that a number of challenges and drawbacks exist for these types of use cases, including:
    - Access to private data sources often must be negotiated or bought, “which potentially means substituting negotiations with corporations for those with national statistical offices;”
    - The meaning of such data is not always simple or stable, and local knowledge is needed to understand how people are using the technologies in question
    - Bias in proprietary data can be hard to understand and quantify;
    - Lack of privacy frameworks; and
    - Power asymmetries, wherein “LMIC citizens are unwittingly placed in a panopticon staffed by international researchers, with no way out and no legal recourse.”

  shortDescription: A working paper describing how privately held data sources could
    fill current gaps in the efforts of National Statistics Offices.
  annotation: |-
    This working paper acknowledges the growing body of work on how different types of data (e.g, telecom data, social media, sensors and geospatial data, etc.) can address data gaps relevant to National Statistical Offices (NSOs).

    Four models of public-private interaction for statistics are describe: in-house production of statistics by a data-provider for a national statistics office (NSO), transfer of data-sets to NSOs from private entities, transfer of data to a third party provider to manage the NSO and private entity data, and the outsourcing of NSO functions.

    The paper highlights challenges to public-private partnerships involving data (e.g., technical challenges, data confidentiality, risks, limited incentives for participation), suggests deliberate and highly structured approaches to public-private partnerships involving data require enforceable contracts, emphasizes the trade-off between data specificity and accessibility of such data, and the importance of pricing mechanisms that reflect the capacity and capability of national statistic offices.

    Case studies referenced in the paper include:
    - A mobile network operator’s (MNO Telefonica) in house analysis of call detail records;
    - A third-party data provider and steward of travel statistics (Positium);
    - The Data for Development (D4D) challenge organized by MNO Orange; and
    - Statistics Netherlands use of social media to predict consumer confidence.

    '
  annotation: |-
    This paper discusses the concept of a “boundary organization” in relation to industry-academic partnerships driven by data. Boundary organizations perform mediated revealing, allowing firms to disclose their research problems to a broad audience of innovators and simultaneously minimize the risk that this information would be adversely used by competitors.

    The authors identify two especially important challenges for private firms to enter open data or participate in data collaboratives with the academic research community that could be addressed through more involvement from boundary organizations:
    - First is a challenge of maintaining competitive advantage. The authors note that, “the more a firm attempts to align the efforts in an open data research programme with its R&D priorities, the more it will have to reveal about the problems it is addressing within its proprietary R&D.”
    - Second, involves the misalignment of incentives between the private and academic field. Perkmann and Schildt argue that, a firm seeking to build collaborations around its opened data “will have to provide suitable incentives that are aligned with academic scientists’ desire to be rewarded for their work within their respective communities.”

  shortDescription: An analysis of aggregated and anonymized call details records
    (CDR) conducted in collaboration with the UN, Government of Mexico, academia and
    Telefonica suggests high potential in using shared telecom data to improve early
    warning and emergency management mechanisms.
  annotation: |-
    This report describes the impact of using mobile data in order to understand the impact of disasters and improve disaster management. The report was conducted in the Mexican state of Tabasco in 2009 as a multidisciplinary, multi-stakeholder consortium involving the UN World Food Programme (WFP), Telefonica Research, Technical University of Madrid (UPM), Digital Strategy Coordination Office of the President of Mexico, and UN Global Pulse.

    Telefonica Research, a division of the major Latin American telecommunications company, provided call detail records covering flood-affected areas for nine months. This data was combined with “remote sensing data (satellite images), rainfall data, census and civil protection data.” The results of the data demonstrated that “analysing mobile activity during floods could be used to potentially locate damaged areas, efficiently assess needs and allocate resources (for example, sending supplies to affected areas).”

    In addition to the results, the study highlighted “the value of a public-private partnership on using mobile data to accurately indicate flooding impacts in Tabasco, thus improving early warning and crisis management.”

  shortDescription: The transcript of a keynote talk on the potential of leveraging
    corporate data to help solve public problems.
  annotation: "This Medium post from Gideon Mann, the Head of Data Science at Bloomberg,
    shares his prepared remarks given at a lecture at the City College of New York.
    Mann argues for the potential benefits of increasing access to private sector
    data, both to improve research and academic inquiry and also to help solve practical,
    real-world problems. He also describes a number of initiatives underway at Bloomberg
    along these lines.    \n\nMann argues that data generated at private companies
    “could enable amazing discoveries and research,” but is often inaccessible to
    those who could put it to those uses. Beyond research, he notes that corporate
    data could, for instance, benefit:\n- Public health – including suicide prevention,
    addiction counseling and mental health monitoring.\n- Legal and ethical questions
    – especially as they relate to “the role algorithms have in decisions about our
    lives,” such as credit checks and resume screening.\n\nMann recognizes the privacy
    challenges inherent in private sector data sharing, but argues that it is a common
    misconception that the only two choices are “complete privacy or complete disclosure.”
    He believes that flexible frameworks for differential privacy could open up new
    opportunities for responsibly leveraging data collaboratives."

  shortDescription: A journal article primarily focused on the risks involved in health
    data pooling.
  annotation: |-
    This journal article explores the benefits and, in particular, the risks related to large-scale biomedical databases bringing together health information from a diversity of sources across sectors. Some data collaboratives examined in the piece include:
    - __MedMining__ – a company that extracts EHR data, de-identifies it, and offers it to researchers. The data sets that MedMining delivers to its customers include ‘lab results, vital signs, medications, procedures, diagnoses, lifestyle data, and detailed costs’ from inpatient and outpatient facilities.
    - __Explorys__ has formed a large healthcare database derived from financial, administrative, and medical records. It has partnered with major healthcare organizations such as the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and Summa Health System to aggregate and standardize health information from ten million patients and over thirty billion clinical events.

    Hoffman and Podgurski note that biomedical databases populated have many potential uses, with those likely to benefit including: “researchers, regulators, public health officials, commercial entities, lawyers,” as well as “healthcare providers who conduct quality assessment and improvement activities,” regulatory monitoring entities like the FDA, and “litigants in tort cases to develop evidence concerning causation and harm.”

    They argue, however, that risks arise based on:
    - The data contained in biomedical databases is surprisingly likely to be incorrect or incomplete;
    - Systemic biases, arising from both the nature of the data and the preconceptions of investigators are serious threats the validity of research results, especially in answering causal questions;
    - Data mining of biomedical databases makes it easier for individuals with political, social, or economic agendas to generate ostensibly scientific but misleading research findings for the purpose of manipulating public opinion and swaying policymakers.

    mechanisms built around identity management and regulated access.  \n- __Economic__.
    Interventions include a model where data is shared only with a few trusted organizations,
    and yield management mechanisms to ensure negative financial consequences are
    avoided.\n- __Data quality__. Interventions include identifying additional data
    sources that could improve the completeness of datasets, and efforts to improve
    metadata.\n- __Technical__. Interventions include making data available in structured
    formats and publishing data according to widely agreed upon data standards."

    from the commercial sector.
  annotation: |
    This Chatham House report provides an overview on public health surveillance data sharing, highlighting the benefits and challenges of shared health data and the complexity in adapting technical solutions from other sectors for public health.

    The report describes data sharing processes from several perspectives, including in-depth case studies of actual data sharing in practice at the individual, organizational and sector levels. Among the key lessons for public health data sharing, the report strongly highlights the need to harness momentum for action and maintain collaborative engagement: “Successful data sharing communities are highly collaborative. Collaboration holds the key to producing and abiding by community standards, and building and maintaining productive networks, and is by definition the essence of data sharing itself. Time should be invested in establishing and sustaining collaboration with all stakeholders concerned with public health surveillance data sharing.”

    Examples of data collaboratives include H3Africa (a collaboration between NIH and Wellcome Trust) and NHS England’s care.data programme.

  shortDescription: A white paper describing the potential of big data, and corporate
    data in particular, to positively benefit development efforts.
  annotation: |-
    This white paper, produced by “a group of activists, researchers and data experts” explores the potential of big data to improve development outcomes and spur positive social change in low- and middle-income countries. Using examples, the authors discuss four areas in which the use of big data can impact development efforts:
    - Advocating and facilitating by “opening[ing] up new public spaces for discussion and awareness building;
    - Describing and predicting through the detection of “new correlations and the surfac[ing] of new questions;
    -  Facilitating information exchange through “multiple feedback loops which feed into both research and action,” and
    -  Promoting accountability and transparency, especially as a byproduct of crowdsourcing efforts aimed at “aggregat[ing] and analyz[ing] information in real time.

    The authors argue that in order to maximize the potential of big data’s use in development, “there is a case to be made for building a data commons for private/public data, and for setting up new and more appropriate ethical guidelines.”

    They also identify a number of challenges, especially when leveraging data made accessible from a number of sources, including private sector entities, such as:
    - Lack of general data literacy;
    - Lack of open learning environments and repositories;
    - Lack of resources, capacity and access;
    - Challenges of sensitivity and risk perception with regard to using data;
    - Storage and computing capacity; and
    - Externally validating data sources for comparison and verification.

    that will share data: 1) that stakeholders should encourage and foster a professional
    environment in which the responsible sharing of data is the norm; 2) that data
    should be shared within certain timeframes specified within the report; 3) that
    stakeholders should employ operational strategies designed to mitigate risk and
    maximize benefits; and 4) that the sponsors of the IOM study ought to take the
    lead in creating an international framework and infrastructure related to responsible
    sharing of clinical trial data. "

    Purpose
    In “data collaboratives”, private and public organizations coordinate their activities to leverage data to address a societal challenge. This paper aims to focus on analyzing challenges and coordination mechanisms of data collaboratives.

    Design/methodology/approach
    This study uses coordination theory to identify and discuss the coordination problems and coordination mechanisms associated with data collaboratives. The authors also use a taxonomy of data collaborative forms from a previous empirical study to discuss how different forms of data collaboratives may require different coordination mechanisms.

    Findings
    The study analyzed data collaboratives from the perspective of organizational and task levels. At the organizational level, the authors argue that data collaboratives present an example of the bazaar form of coordination. At the task level, the authors identified five coordination problems and discussed potential coordination mechanisms to address them, such as coordination by negotiation, by third party, by standardization, to name a few.

    Research limitations/implications
    This study is one of the first few to systematically analyze the phenomenon of “data collaboratives”.

    Practical implications
    This study can help practitioners better understand the coordination challenges they may face when initiating a data collaborative and to develop successful data collaboratives by using coordination mechanisms to mitigate these challenges.

    Originality/value
    Data collaboratives are a novel form of data-driven initiatives which have seen rapid experimentation lately. This study draws attention to this concept in the academic literature and highlights some of the complexities of organizing data collaboratives in practice.

    academics, these data are often inaccessible to university researchers. We propose
    here a new model for industry-academic partnerships that addresses these problems
    via a novel organizational structure: Respected scholars form a commission which,
    as a trusted third party, receives access to all relevant firm information and
    systems, and then recruits independent academics to do research in specific areas
    following standard peer review protocols organized and funded by nonprofit foundations.
    We also report on a partnership we helped forge under this model to make data
    available about the extremely visible and highly politicized issues surrounding
    the impact of social media on elections and democracy. In our partnership, Facebook
    will provide privacy-preserving data and access; seven major politically and substantively
    diverse nonprofit foundations will fund the research; and the Social Science Research
    Council will oversee the peer review process for funding and data access.'

    It finds that the addition of the Internet search index improves forecasting over
    benchmark models in about 20 percent of the series and discusses the reasons for
    the varied success and potential avenues for future research.
  annotation: |
    - Seabold and Coppola obtained the consumer price data from the statistical office of each country, and also Google Trends data on a number of search keywords and found that the Google Trends data improved nowcasts of price, compared to an ARMA model and other respective benchmarks
    - They conclude by saying that "the study of the manifestation of consumer sentiment via Internet search behavior is very much still in its infancy. It certainly presents a number of challenges, but the potential insights and use cases are varied and exciting. It may be tempting to dismiss this excitement as hype. All the same, it is difficult to deny the possible benefits of real-time consumer sentiment to future economics research and forecasting studies."

    companies initiating data collaboratives, including:\n- \"Facebook would fund
    one of his graduate students to use the company’s technology to study how economic
    data from public surveys correlated with the visual characteristics of buildings
    represented in the satellite data. Facebook, in turn, could potentially gain a

    are least likely to have Internet connections.\"\n- \"Microsoft’s AI for Earth,

    than 20 countries to analyse remote-sensing data sets from Esri, a mapping and
    geospatial-analysis company in Redlands, California, using Microscoft’s artificial
    intelligence (AI) algorithms and computing power.\" \n- \"Amazon Web Services,
    the cloud-computing branch of the e-commerce giant Amazon, started hosting the
    Landsat archive in early 2015. In September 2016, the company launched its Earth
    on AWS programme, through which it hosts around 15 data sets, including imagery,
    weather data from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and
    air-quality data from the non-profit organization OpenAQ in Washington DC. Although

  title: Migration Data using Social Media

  shortDescription: While research on the use of big data sources for migration is
    in its infancy, and the diffusion of internet technologies in less developed countries
    is still limited, the use of big data sources can unveil useful insights on quantitative
    and qualitative characteristics of migration.
  annotation: |
    In this report, the authors examine social media data to study migration patterns:
    - "Innovative sources offer data that are timely, have a wide coverage, can be accessible at limited cost, and can potentially include information that may not always be provided by traditional migration data sources. As of April 2018, the Facebook Network (i.e. Facebook,Instagram, Messenger and the Audience Network) reported more than 2.15 billion monthly active users. The digital traces that Internet users are actively or passively generating can potentially be exploited for studying migration-related phenomena."
    - "The potential of new data sources (e.g.Facebook) to provide policy-relevant information on international migration is currently being explored by international bodies and initiatives such as the Big Data for Migration Alliance (BD4M), recently launched by the European Commission Knowledge Centre on Migration and Demography (KCMD) and IOM’s Global Migration Data Analysis Centre (GMDAC), following a dedicated workshop on the topic.
    - "The inherent bias of social media data described above, coupled with the risk of a lack of control on how the data are derived and processed cause uncertainties regarding the possibility of effectively using such data for demographic research. This requires the development of appropriate methods for quantifying and mitigating such bias as well as the active collaboration with the social media companies themselves."
    - "The paper shows that social media applications can be a timely, low-cost, and almost globally available data source for estimating stocks of international migrants, based on estimates of users who are classified as 'expats.' In the European context, it can be used for quantifying intra-EU mobility patterns of specific demographic groups, such as students,as well as for measuring migration movements that may not be captured in as timely a fashion by official statistics."

    "Much of the recent excitement around data, especially ‘Big Data,’ focuses on the potential commercial or economic value of data. How that data will affect people isn’t much discussed. People know that smart cities will deploy Internet-based monitoring and that flows of the collected data promise to produce new values. Less considered is that smart cities will be sites of new forms of citizen action—enabled by an ‘economy’ of data that will lead to new methods of collectivization, accountability, and control which, themselves, can provide both positive and negative values to the citizenry. Therefore, smart city design needs to consider not just measurement and publication of data but also the implications of city-wide deployment, data openness, and the possibility of unintended consequences if data leave the city."

    "The breadcrumbs we leave behind when using our mobile phones—who somebody calls, for how long, and from where—contain unprecedented insights about us and our societies. Researchers have compared the recent availability of large-scale behavioral datasets, such as the ones generated by mobile phones, to the invention of the microscope, giving rise to the new field of computational social science."
  annotation: |
    - The authors point out that the high penetration of mobile phone creates an abundance of data which can be useful in informing policymaking process, but also poses privacy risk to individuals that the data is associated with.
    - The authors argue that standard de-identification methodology for data analysis is "not sufficient to prevent users from being re-identified in mobile phone data".
    - Furthermore, "[th]hese privacy concerns are, in our opinion, due to the failures of the traditional de-identification model and the lack of a modern and agreed upon framework for the privacy-conscientious use of mobile phone data by third-parties especially in the context of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)."
    - In this paper, the authors propose four models for the privacy-conscientious use of mobile phone data to address this issue.

    "Driven by the technological capabilities that ICTs offer, data enable new ways to generate value for both society and the parties that own or offer the data. This article looks at the idea of data collaboratives as a form of cross-sector partnership to exchange and integrate data and data use to generate public value. The concept thereby bridges data-driven value creation and collaboration, both current themes in the field. To understand how data collaboratives can add value in a public governance context, we exploratively studied the qualitative longitudinal case of an infomobility platform. We investigated the ability of a data collaborative to produce results while facing significant challenges and tensions between the goals of parties, each having the conflicting objectives of simultaneously retaining control whilst allowing for generativity. Taken together, the literature and case study findings help us to understand the emergence and viability of data collaboratives. Although limited by this study’s explorative nature, we find that conditions such as prior history of collaboration and supportive rules of the game are key to the emergence of collaboration. Positive feedback between trust and the collaboration process can institutionalise the collaborative, which helps it survive if conditions change for the worse."

    Abstract:

    Data platform companies (such as Facebook, Google, or Twitter) amass and process immense amounts of data that is generated by their users. These companies primarily use the data to advance their commercial interests, but there is a growing public dismay regarding the adverse and discriminatory impacts of their algorithms on society at large. The regulation of data platform companies and their algorithms has been hotly debated in the literature, but current approaches often neglect the value of data collection, defy the logic of algorithmic decision-making, and exceed the platform companies’ operational capacities.

    This Article suggests a different approach — an open, collaborative, and incentives-based stance toward data platforms that takes full advantage of the tremendous societal value of user-generated data. It contends that this data shall be recognized as a “global commons,” and access to it shall be made available to a wide range of independent stakeholders — research institutions, journalists, public authorities, and international organizations. These external actors would be able to utilize the data to address a variety of public challenges, as well as observe from within the operation and impacts of the platforms’ algorithms.

    After making the theoretical case for the “global commons of data,” the Article explores the practical implementation of this model. First, it argues that a data commons regime should operate through a spectrum of data sharing and usage modalities that would protect the commercial interests of data platforms and the privacy of data users. Second, it discusses regulatory measures and incentives that can solicit the collaboration of platform companies with the commons model. Lastly, it explores the challenges embedded in this approach.

    variety of contexts."

    - This paper presents a legal-technical framework that will ensure that accountability and transparency that are acquired through data sharing do not harm individual privacy.
    - This proposed solution seeks to address the challenge often faced when a set of data is too sensitive to be "open", hindering the creation of a more effective research and policy that affect the public.
    - The authors propose a "third-party public-private data trust", which will act as  an intermediary who will ensure "a) strong privacy guarantees, b) removal of signals that could expose competitive advantage for the data providers, and c) removal of biases that could reinforce discriminatory policies".

    - Towards a more general open (public and private) data environment and a "common European data space"?
  annotation: |-
    Abstract:
    "Thanks to appropriate data algorithms, firms, especially those on-line, are able to extract detailed knowledge about consumers and markets. This raises the question of the essential facility character of data. Moreover, the features of digital markets lead to a concentration of this core input in the hands of few big “superstars” and arouse legitimate economic and societal concerns. In a more and more data-driven society, one could ask if data openness is a solution to deal with power derived from data concentration. We conclude that only a case-by-case approach should be followed. Mandatory open data policy should be conditioned on an ex-ante cost-benefit analysis proving that the benefits of disclosure exceed its costs."

  title: 'How Search Engine Data Enhance the Understanding of Determinants of Suicide
    in India and Inform Prevention: Observational Study'

  shortDescription: '"As the product of a data collaborative, this paper leverages
    private-sector search engine data toward gaining a fuller, more accurate picture
    of the suicide issue among young people in India."'
  annotation: |-
    Abstract:

    "Background: India is home to 20% of the world’s suicide deaths. Although statistics regarding suicide in India are distressingly high, data and cultural issues likely contribute to a widespread underreporting of the problem. Social stigma and only recent decriminalization of suicide are among the factors hampering official agencies’ collection and reporting of suicide rates.

    "Objective: As the product of a data collaborative, this paper leverages private-sector search engine data toward gaining a fuller, more accurate picture of the suicide issue among young people in India. By combining official statistics on suicide with data generated through search queries, this paper seeks to: add an additional layer of information to more accurately represent the magnitude of the problem, determine whether search query data can serve as an effective proxy for factors contributing to suicide that are not represented in traditional datasets, and consider how data collaboratives built on search query data could inform future suicide prevention efforts in India and beyond.

    "Methods: We combined official statistics on demographic information with data generated through search queries from Bing to gain insight into suicide rates per state in India as reported by the National Crimes Record Bureau of India. We extracted English language queries on “suicide,” “depression,” “hanging,” “pesticide,” and “poison”. We also collected data on demographic information at the state level in India, including urbanization, growth rate, sex ratio, internet penetration, and population. We modeled the suicide rate per state as a function of the queries on each of the 5 topics considered as linear independent variables. A second model was built by integrating the demographic information as additional linear independent variables.

    "Results: Results of the first model fit (R2) when modeling the suicide rates from the fraction of queries in each of the 5 topics, as well as the fraction of all suicide methods, show a correlation of about 0.5. This increases significantly with the removal of 3 outliers and improves slightly when 5 outliers are removed. Results for the second model fit using both query and demographic data show that for all categories, if no outliers are removed, demographic data can model suicide rates better than query data. However, when 3 outliers are removed, query data about pesticides or poisons improves the model over using demographic data.

    "Conclusions: In this work, we used search data and demographics to model suicide rates. In this way, search data serve as a proxy for unmeasured (hidden) factors corresponding to suicide rates. Moreover, our procedure for outlier rejection serves to single out states where the suicide rates have substantially different correlations with demographic factors and query rates."

    Abstract:
    "In their report on the development of the UK AI industry, Wendy Hall and Jérôme Pesenti recommend the establishment of data trusts, “proven and trusted frameworks and agreements” that will “ensure exchanges [of data] are secure and mutually beneficial” by promoting trust in the use of data for AI. This paper defends the following thesis: A data trust works within the law to provide ethical, architectural and governance support for trustworthy data processing. Data trusts are therefore both constraining and liberating. They constrain: they respect current law, so they cannot render currently illegal actions legal. They are intended to increase trust, and so they will typically act as further constraints on data processors, adding the constraints of trustworthiness to those of law. Yet they also liberate: if data processors are perceived as trustworthy, they will get improved access to data. The paper addresses the areas of: trust and trustworthiness; ethics; architecture; legal status."

    - The author argues that the "system of federal economic statistics developed in the 20th century has served the country well, but the current methods for collecting and disseminating these data products are unsustainable. These statistics are heavily reliant on the great 20th century measurement innovation: sample surveys. Recently, however, response rates for both household and business surveys have declined, increasing costs and threatening quality."
    - He further points out that existing "statistical measures, many developed decades ago, may also miss important aspects of our rapidly evolving economy; moreover, they may not be sufficiently accurate, timely, or granular to meet the increasingly complex needs of data users. Meanwhile, the rapid proliferation of online data and more powerful computation make privacy and confidentiality protections more challenging."
    - He concludes that "current measurement programs are not keeping pace with the changing economy, and current methods for collecting and disseminating statistical information are not sustainable. A process is underway in which government statisticians will take greater advantage of the proliferation of new data sources that can be utilized for economic measurement, as well as new tools for processing, analyzing, and publishing improved economic statistics."

    - "That the task of creating trust is different in different fields. Overly generic solutions will be likely to fail.
    - "That trusts need to be accountable—in some cases to individual members where there is a direct relationship with individuals giving consent, in other cases to the broader public.
    - "That we should expect a variety of types of data trust to form—some sharing data; some managing synthetic data; some providing a research capability; some using commercial data and so on.

    Abstract:
    "Indigenous communities and scholars have been influencing a shift in participation and inclusion in academic and agency research over the past two decades. As a response, Indigenous peoples are increasingly asking research questions and developing their own studies rooted in their cultural values. They use the study results to rebuild their communities and to protect their lands. This process of Indigenous-driven research has led to partnering with academic institutions, establishing research review boards, and entering into data sharing agreements to protect environmental data, community information, and local and traditional knowledges.Data sharing agreements provide insight into how Indigenous nations are addressing the key areas of data collection, ownership, application, storage, and the potential for data reuse in the future. By understanding this mainstream data governance mechanism, how they have been applied, and how they have been used in the past, we aim to describe how Indigenous nations and communities negotiate data protection and control with researchers.

    "The project described here reviewed publicly available data sharing agreements that focus on research with Indigenous nations and communities in the United States. We utilized qualitative analysis methods to identify specific areas of focus in the data sharing agreements, whether or not traditional or cultural values were included in the language of the data sharing agreements, and how the agreements defined data. The results detail how Indigenous peoples currently use data sharing agreements and potential areas of expansion for language to include in data sharing agreements as Indigenous peoples address the research needs of their communities and the protection of community and cultural data."

  annotation: |-
    - The authors point out that "health and genetic data are considered special categories of personal data and are subject to relatively stringent rules for processing."
    - Furthermore, according to the GDPR, "personal data may be collected only for specific, explicit, and legitimate purposes. The GDPR considers further use of these data for scientific research purposes to be compatible with the original rationale for collection. Yet, it also recognizes the right of study participants to object to this use of their data, to withdraw consent if they wish, and to be informed of any data breaches. To exercise their rights, individuals must be informed about the processing of their data in the research repository. However, the way some repositories are set up might make it difficult for researchers to comply with the law. One such challenge centers on the oversight of data access."
    - The authors propose that developing "solutions that support data deposition while ensuring legal compliance is necessary for research. Adopting the right solutions will lead to greater transparency and accountability in data sharing, as well as a more efficient and equitable scientific practice."

  annotation: |
    - According to this paper, of "the 232 SDG indicators, only 93 are classified as Tier 1, meaning that the indicator is conceptually clear, has internationally established methodology and standards, and data are regularly compiled for at least 50 per cent of the countries. The remaining indicators are Tier 2 (72 indicators) meaning the indicator is conceptually clear but the data are not regularly produced by countries or Tier 3 (62 indicators), meaning that no internationally established methodology or standards are yet available."
    - The author points out that the potential of big data has generated much excitement and argument, but it also has many legal, ethical, technical, and reputational risks.
    - According to the author many "big data are proprietary, that is, data that are commercially or privately owned and not publicly available. Consequently, many big data are not currently accessible by NSOs, either because costs are prohibitive or proprietary ownership makes it impossible. For example, data generated from the use of credit cards, search engines, social media, mobile phones, and store loyalty cards are all proprietary and are often not accessible. In many cases there are also legal impediments to accessing big data. MacFeely and Barnat (2017) have argued that to futureproof statistical legislation, changes may be required to give NSOs or NSSs access to big data sources."
    - Two challenges arise from this problem: one technical and one of perception. "The technical challenge arises from the availability of large, linkable datasets which make anonymization of individual data very difficult. ... The changing nature of perception is arguably a trickier problem. ... There appear to be inter-generational differences in opinion vis-a-vis privacy and confidentiality, where those ‘born digital’ (roughly those born since 1990) are less concerned about disclosing personal information than older generations (European Commission, 2011)."

    - "The problem of unicity and reidentifiability of records in large-scale databases has been studied in different contexts and approaches, with focus on preserving privacy or matching records from different data sources.

    - "We extract the relevant statistical properties which influence the matching process and analyze their impact on the matchability of users.
    - "We show that for individuals with typical activity in the transportation system (those making 3-4 trips per day on average), a matching algorithm based on the co-occurrence of their activities is expected to achieve a 16.8% success only after a one-week long observation of their mobility traces, and over 55% after four weeks.
    - "We show that the main determinant of matchability is the expected number of co-occurring records in the two datasets. Finally, we discuss different scenarios in terms of data collection frequency and give estimates of matchability over time.

    The report argues that data sharing can "increase the value of data to the data holder, and even more so to secondary data users, with additional positive spill-over benefits for country economies and society at large."

    However, several challenges need to be addressed so that the public can harness the benefit of data sharing. Such challenges such as balancing "the benefits of enhancing data "openness" with the risks, while considering legitimate private, national and public interests."

    Examining over 200 policy initiatives across 37 countries, the report finds several trends, such as "few countries have policy initiatives to faciliate data sharing within the private sector."

    Finally, the report proposes that policy makers employ several strategies involving contractual agreements, open data, data portability, and restricted data-sharing agreement to address the major challenges.

We develop a framework to assess the democratic legitimacy of two types of data partnerships: open data partnerships (where data and insights are mainly freely available) and closed data partnerships (where data and insights are mainly shared within a network of organizations). Our framework specifies criteria for assessing the legitimacy of relevant partnerships with regard to their input legitimacy as well as their output legitimacy. We demonstrate which particular characteristics of open and closed partnerships can be expected to influence an analysis of their input and output legitimacy."

These safe environments would exist outside the government, be transparent to the public, and use modern technologies and techniques to allow only statistical uses of data through temporary linkages in order to minimize the risk to individuals’ privacy.
    - "Governments must lead the way in sharing more data by re-evaluating laws that limit sharing of data, and must embrace new technologies that could allow the private sector to receive at least some value from many sensitive data sets.
    - "By decreasing the cost and risks of sharing data, more data will be freed from their silos, and we will move closer to what we deserve—that our data are used for the greatest societal benefit."

  shortDescription: LinkedIn created a generalized metadata search and discovery tool,
    DataHub, to help scale up productivity and innovation that require their data
    assets.
  annotation: "\"As the operator of the world’s largest professional network and the
    Economic Graph, LinkedIn’s Data team is constantly working on scaling its infrastructure
    to meet the demands of our ever-growing big data ecosystem. As the data grows
    in volume and richness, it becomes increasingly challenging for data scientists
    and engineers to discover the data assets available, understand their provenances,
    and take appropriate actions based on the insights. To help us continue scaling
    productivity and innovation in data alongside this growth, we created a generalized
    metadata search and discovery tool, DataHub.\n\n\"As a result, we decided to expand
    the scope of the project to build a fully generalized metadata search and discovery
    tool, DataHub, with an ambitious vision: connecting LinkedIn employees with data
    that matters to them. \n\n\"We broke the monolithic WhereHows stack into two distinct
    stacks: a Modular UI frontend and a Generalized Metadata Architecture backend.
    The new architecture enabled us to rapidly expand our scope of metadata collection
    beyond just datasets and jobs. At the time of writing, DataHub already stores
    and indexes tens of millions of metadata records that encompass 19 different entities,
    including datasets, metrics, jobs, charts, AI features, people, and groups. We
    also plan to onboard metadata for machine learning models and labels, experiments,
    dashboards, microservice APIs, and code in the near future.\""

  annotation: "Abstract: \n\n\"Mobile phone data have been extensively used to study
    urban mobility. However, studies based on gender-disaggregated large-scale data
    are still lacking, limiting our understanding of gendered aspects of urban mobility
    and our ability to design policies for gender equality. Here we study urban mobility
    from a gendered perspective, combining commercial and open datasets for the city
    of Santiago, Chile. We analyze call detail records for a large cohort of anonymized
    mobile phone users and reveal a gender gap in mobility: women visit fewer unique
    locations than men, and distribute their time less equally among such locations.
    Mapping this mobility gap over administrative divisions, we observe that a wider
    gap is associated with lower income and lack of public and private transportation
    options. Our results uncover a complex interplay between gendered mobility patterns,
    socio-economic factors and urban affordances, calling for further research and
    providing insights for policymakers and urban planners.\"\n"

  shortDescription: A report sharing initial lessons learned from the Contracts for
    Data Collaboration initiative (C4DC) and its study of core components of data
    sharing agreements and other legal instruments to enable data collaboratives.
  annotation: "Abstract: \n\n\"In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, data has never
    been more salient. COVID has generated new data demands and increased cross-sector
    data collaboration. Yet, these data collaborations require careful planning and
    evaluation of risks and opportunities, especially when sharing sensitive data.
    Data sharing agreements (DSAs) are written agreements that establish the terms
    for how data are shared between parties and are important for establishing accountability
    and trust. However, negotiating DSAs is often time consuming, and collaborators
    lacking legal or financial capacity are disadvantaged. Contracts for Data Collaboration
    (C4DC) is a joint initiative between SDSN TReNDS, NYU’s GovLab, the World Economic
    Forum, and the University of Washington, working to strengthen trust and transparency
    of data collaboratives. The partners have created an online library of DSAs which
    represents a selection of data applications and contexts. This report introduces
    C4DC and its DSA library. We demonstrate how the library can support the data
    community to strengthen future data collaborations by showcasing various DSA applications
    and key considerations. First, we explain our method of analyzing the agreements
    and consider how six major issues are addressed by different agreements in the
    library. Key issues discussed include data use, access, breaches, proprietary
    issues, publicization of the analysis, and deletion of data upon termination of
    the agreement. For each of these issues, we describe approaches illustrated with
    examples from the library. While our analysis suggests some pertinent issues are
    regularly not addressed in DSAs, we have identified common areas of practice that
    may be helpful for entities negotiating partnership agreements to consider in
    the future.\""

    local and regional NGOs that are best-positioned to provide support to people
    adversely affected by a disaster."
  annotation: "Abstract: \n\n\"This paper provides the humanitarian community with
    an automated tool that can detect a disaster using tweets posted on Twitter, alongside
    a portal to identify local and regional Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs)
    that are best-positioned to provide support to people adversely affected by a
    disaster. The proposed disaster detection tool uses a linear Support Vector Classifier
    (SVC) to detect man-made and natural disasters, and a density-based spatial clustering
    of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to accurately estimate a disaster’s
    geographic location. This paper provides two original contributions. The first
    is combining the automated disaster detection tool with the prototype portal for
    NGO identification. This unique combination could help reduce the time taken to
    raise awareness of the disaster detected, improve the coordination of aid, increase
    the amount of aid delivered as a percentage of initial donations and improve aid
    effectiveness. The second contribution is a general framework that categorises
    the different approaches that can be adopted for disaster detection. Furthermore,
    this paper uses responses obtained from an on-the-ground survey with NGOs in the
    disaster-hit region of Uttar Pradesh, India, to provide actionable insights into
    how the portal can be developed further.\""

  annotation: "Abstract: \n\n\"Preservation of data privacy and protection of sensitive
    information from potential adversaries constitute a key socio‐technical challenge
    in the modern era of ubiquitous digital transformation. Addressing this challenge
    needs analysis of multiple factors: algorithmic choices for balancing privacy

    implications for data owners, data subjects, and data sharing policies, and access
    control mechanisms that need to be built into interactive data interfaces. Visualization
    has a key role to play as part of the solution space, both as a medium of privacy‐aware
    information communication and also as a tool for understanding the link between
    privacy parameters and data sharing policies. The field of privacy‐preserving

  shortDescription: A paper arguing for "moving towards a sociology of social research

  annotation: "Abstract: \n\n\"The phenomenon of big data does not only deeply affect
    current societies but also poses crucial challenges to social research. This article
    argues for moving towards a sociology of social research in order to characterize
    the new qualities of big data and its deficiencies. We draw on the neopragmatist
    approach of economics of convention (EC) as a conceptual basis for such a sociological
    perspective. This framework suggests investigating processes of quantification
    in their interplay with orders of justifications and logics of evaluation. Methodological
    issues such as the question of the \"quality of big data\" must accordingly be
    discussed in their deep entanglement with epistemic values, institutional forms,
    and historical contexts and as necessarily implying political issues such as who
    controls and has access to data infrastructures. On this conceptual basis, the
    article uses the example of health to discuss the challenges of big data analysis
    for social research. Phenomena such as the rise of new and massive privately owned
    data infrastructures, the economic valuation of huge amounts of connected data,
    or the movement of \"quantified self\" are presented as indications of a profound
    transformation compared to established forms of doing social research. Methodological
    and epistemological, but also institutional and political, strategies are presented
    to face the risk of being \"outperformed\" and \"replaced\" by big data analysis
    as they are already done in big US American and Chinese Internet enterprises.
    In conclusion, we argue that the sketched developments have important implications
    both for research practices and methods teaching in the era of big data\""

    they operate in order to reassert their role in modern democratic society. The
    issue at stake is considerably broader and deeper than merely adapting existing
    processes to embrace so-called Big Data. In several aspects, such evolution entails
    a fundamental paradigm shift with respect to the legacy model of official statistics
    production based on traditional data sources, for example, in the relation between
    data and computation, between data collection and analysis, between methodological
    development and statistical production, and of course in the roles of the various
    stakeholders and their mutual relationships. Such complex evolution must be guided

  shortDescription: 'A journal article that finds when it comes to “big data technologies,”
    people’s rate of adoption tends to be driven by self-interest and data protection. '
  annotation: "Abstract: \n\n\"Big data technologies have both benefits and costs
    which can influence their adoption and moral acceptability. Prior studies look
    at people's evaluations in isolation without pitting costs and benefits against
    each other. We address this limitation with a conjoint experiment (N = 979), using
    six domains (criminal investigations, crime prevention, citizen scores, healthcare,
    banking, and employment), where we simultaneously test the relative influence
    of four factors: the status quo, outcome favorability, data sharing, and data
    protection on decisions to adopt and perceptions of moral acceptability of the
    technologies. We present two key findings. (1) People adopt technologies more
    often when data is protected and when outcomes are favorable. They place equal
    or more importance on data protection in all domains except healthcare where outcome
    favorability has the strongest influence. (2) Data protection is the strongest
    driver of moral acceptability in all domains except healthcare, where the strongest
    driver is outcome favorability. Additionally, sharing data lowers preference for
    all technologies, but has a relatively smaller influence. People do not show a
    status quo bias in the adoption of technologies. When evaluating moral acceptability,
    people show a status quo bias but this is driven by the citizen scores domain.
    Differences across domains arise from differences in magnitude of the effects
    but the effects are in the same direction. Taken together, these results highlight
    that people are not always primarily driven by self-interest and do place importance
    on potential privacy violations. The results also challenge the assumption that
    people generally prefer the status quo.\""

  shortDescription: The authors propose a data sharing strategy that can improve the
    usability of hydrological data.
  annotation: |-
    Abstract:

    "Data sharing plays a fundamental role in providing data resources for geographic modeling and simulation. Although there are many successful cases of data sharing through the web, current practices for sharing data mostly focus on data publication using metadata at the file level, which requires identifying, restructuring and synthesizing raw data files for further usage. In hydrology, because the same hydrological information is often stored in data files with different formats, modelers should identify the required information from multisource data sets and then customize data requirements for their applications. However, these data customization tasks are difficult to repeat, which leads to repetitive labor. This paper presents a data sharing method that provides a solution for data manipulation based on a structured data description model rather than raw data files. With the structured data description model, multisource hydrological data can be accessed and processed in a unified way and published as data services using a designed data server. This study also proposes a data configuration manager to customize data requirements through an interactive programming tool, which can help in using the data services. In addition, a component-based data viewer is developed for the visualization of multisource data in a sharable visualization scheme. A case study that involves sharing and applying hydrological data is designed to examine the applicability and feasibility of the proposed data sharing method."

    "The Japanese government has initiated lifelong learning policies to promote lifelong learning to a super-aging society. It is said that lifelong learning contributes to a richer and more fulfilling life. It is within this context that public libraries have been identified as ideal facilities for promoting lifelong learning. To support lifelong learning successfully, libraries must accurately grasp citizens’ needs, all while working within limited budgets. To understand citizens’ learning needs, this study uses public library circulation data. This study is significant because such data use is often unavailable in Japan. This data was used to clarify citizens’ learning interests. Circulation data was compared from two libraries in Japan: Koto District Library in Tokyo and Tahara City Library in Aichi Prefecture. The data was used to identify general learning needs while also accounting for regional differences. The methodology and results of this research are significant for the development of lifelong learning policy and programming."

    From the abstract:
    "To foster responsible data sharing in health research, ethical governance complementary to the EU General Data Protection Regulation is necessary. A governance framework for Big Data-driven research platforms will at least need to consider the conditions as specified a priori for individual datasets. We aim to identify and analyze these conditions for the Innovative Medicines Initiative’s (IMI) BigData@Heart platform."
  annotation: |-
    From the abstract:

    Methods
    "We performed a unique descriptive case study into the conditions for data sharing as specified for datasets participating in BigData@Heart. Principle investigators of 56 participating databases were contacted via e-mail with the request to send any kind of documentation that possibly specified the conditions for data sharing. Documents were qualitatively reviewed for conditions pertaining to data sharing and data access."

    Results
    "Qualitative content analysis of 55 relevant documents revealed overlap on the conditions: (1) only to share health data for scientific research, (2) in anonymized/coded form, (3) after approval from a designated review committee, and while (4) observing all appropriate measures for data security and in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations."

    Conclusions
    "Despite considerable overlap, prespecified conditions give rise to challenges for data sharing. At the same time, these challenges inform our thinking about the design of an ethical governance framework for data sharing platforms. We urge current data sharing initiatives to concentrate on: (1) the scope of the research questions that may be addressed, (2) how to deal with varying levels of de-identification, (3) determining when and how review committees should come into play, (4) align what policies and regulations mean by “data sharing” and (5) how to deal with datasets that have no system in place for data sharing."

  shortDescription: This case study analyzes the implementation of a data collaborative
    project, where MIT Media Lab researchers used location data provided by Cuebiq
    to understand social inequality.
  annotation: |-
    Summary:

    "The Atlas of Inequality is a research initiative led by scientists at the MIT Media Lab and Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. It is a project within the larger Human Dynamics research initiative at the MIT Media Lab, which investigates how computational social science can improve society, government, and companies. Using multiple big data sources, MIT Media Lab researchers seek to understand how people move in urban spaces and how that movement influences or is influenced by income. Among the datasets used in this initiative was location data provided by Cuebiq, through its Data for Good initiative. Cuebiq offers location-intelligence services to approved research and nonprofit organizations seeking to address public problems. To date, the Atlas has published maps of inequality in eleven cities in the United States. Through the Atlas, the researchers hope to raise public awareness about segregation of social mobility in United States cities resulting from economic inequality and support evidence-based policymaking to address the issue.

    "Data Collaborative Model: Based on the typology of data collaborative practice areas developed by The GovLab, the use of Cuebiq’s location data by MIT Media Lab researchers for the Atlas of Inequality initiative is an example of the research and analysis partnership model of data collaboration, specifically a data transfer approach. In this approach, companies provide data to partners for analysis, sometimes under the banner of “data philanthropy.” Access to data remains highly restrictive, with only specific partners able to analyze the assets provided. Approved uses are also determined in a somewhat cooperative manner, often with some agreement outlining how and why parties requesting access to data will put it to use.

    "Data Stewardship Approach: Through its Data for Good initiative, Cuebiq provided access to location data that supported the Atlas’s development. The Data for Good initiative is an example of how active data stewardship can help data-holding companies find public utility in their data beyond their day-to-day business. Such utility includes the creation of scientific and public value by securely providing academic researchers and nonprofit organizations access to Cuebiq’s data assets. These collaborations involve a licensing agreement between Cuebiq and its partners, where all the parties pledge to adhere to certain privacy and data-handling standards to prevent potential risks that may arise, such as data breach and misuse. Further, Cuebiq also created the Director of Research Partnership and Data for Good role to carry out various data stewards functions, including internal coordination, partnership building, and risk assessment. This approach can serve as a good model for how companies can practice responsible data-sharing. Indeed, in early 2020, the MIT Media Lab team began using Cuebiq data to study the effectiveness of social distancing policies in New York City in light of the COVID-19 pandemic."

  annotation: |-
    From the abstract:

    "This result is obtained by estimating the impact of public data transparency on sovereign spreads conditional on the country's level of institutional quality and public and external debt. While improving data transparency alone reduces the external borrowing costs for a country, the return is much higher when combined with stronger institutional quality and lower public and external debt. Similarly, the returns on investing in data transparency are higher when a country's integration to the global economy deepens, as captured by trade and financial openness. Estimation of an instrumental variable regression shows that Sub-Saharan African countries could have saved up to 14.5 basis points in sovereign bond spreads and decreased their external debt burden by US$405.4 million (0.02 percent of gross domestic product) in 2018, if their average level of data transparency was that of a country in the top quartile of the upper-middle-income country category. At the country level, Angola could have reduced its external debt burden by around US$73.6 million."

    Abstract:

    "Building on an illustrative case of a systemic environmental threat and its multi‐stakeholder response, this paper draws attention to the changing political impacts of corporations in the digital age. Political Corporate Social Responsibility (PCSR) theory suggests an expanded sense of politics and corporations, including impacts that may range from voluntary initiatives to overcome governance gaps, to avoiding state regulation via corporate political activity. Considering digitalization as a stimulus, we explore potential responsibilities of corporations toward public goods in contexts with functioning governments. We show that digitalization—in the form of transparency, surveillance, and data‐sharing—offers corporations’ scope for deliberative public participation. The starry sky beetle infestation endangering public and private goods is thereby used to illustrate the possibility of expanding the political role of corporations in the digital sphere. We offer a contribution by conceptualizing data‐deliberation as a Habermasian variation of PCSR, defined as the (a) voluntary disclosure of corporate data and its transparent, open sharing with the public sector (b) along with the cooperation with governmental institutions on data analytics methods for examining large‐scale datasets (c) thereby complying with existing national and international regulations on data protection, in particular with respect to privacy and personal data."

  shortDescription: This case study contains analysis of the implementation of a data
    collaborative project and data stewardship practice in the Accelerating Medicines
    Partnership project.
  annotation: |-
    Summary:

    "Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP) is a cross-sector data-sharing partnership in the United States between the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), multiple biopharmaceutical and life science companies, as well as non-profit organizations that seeks to improve the efficiency of developing new diagnostics and treatments for several types of disease. To achieve this goal, the partnership created a pre-competitive collaborative ecosystem where the biomedical community can pool data and resources that are relevant to the prioritized disease areas. A key component of the partnership is to make biomarkers data available to the medical research community through online portals."

    Data Collaboratives Model:
    "Based on our typology of data collaborative models, AMP is an example of the data pooling model of data collaboration, specifically a public data pool. Public data pools co-mingle data assets from multiple data holders — in this case pharmaceutical companies — and make those shared assets available on the web. Pools often limit contributions to approved partners (as public data pools are not crowdsourcing efforts), but access to the shared assets is open, enabling independent re-uses."

    Data Stewardship Approach:
    "Data stewardship is built into the partnership through the establishment of an executive committee, which governs the entire partnership, and a steering committee for each disease area, which governs each of the sub-projects within AMP. These committees consist of representatives from the institutional partners involved in AMP and perform data stewards function including enabling inter-institutional engagement as well as intra-institutional coordination, data audit and assessment of value and risk, communication of findings, and nurture the collaboration to sustainability."

  shortDescription: The authors "analyzed the contents of thirty-six prominent AI
    principles documents, and in the process, discovered thematic trends that suggest
    the earliest emergence of sectoral norms."
  annotation: |-
    One of the main findings of the analysis concerns eight key themes, which are:

    - "Privacy. Principles under this theme stand for the idea that AI systems should respect individuals’ privacy, both in the use of data for the development of technological systems and by providing impacted people with agency over their data and decisions made with it. Privacy principles are present in 97% of documents in the dataset.
    - "Accountability. This theme includes principles concerning the importance
    of mechanisms to ensure that accountability for the impacts of AI systems is appropriately distributed, and that adequate remedies are provided. Accountability principles are present in 97% of documents in the dataset.
    - "Safety and Security. These principles express requirements that AI systems be safe, performing as intended, and also secure, resistant to being compromised by unauthorized parties. Safety and Security principles are present in 81% of documents in the dataset.
    - "Transparency and Explainability. Principles under this theme articulate requirements that AI systems be designed and implemented to allow for oversight, including through translation of their operations into intelligible outputs and the provision of information about where, when, and how they are being used. Transparency and Explainability principles are present in 94% of documents in the dataset.
    - "Fairness and Non-discrimination. With concerns about AI bias already impacting individuals globally, Fairness and Non-discrimination principles call for AI systems to be designed and used to maximize fairness and promote inclusivity. Fairness and Non-discrimination principles are present in 100% of documents in the dataset.

    Craigslist rental listings and find they supply significantly different volumes,

  annotation: |+
    "This article drew together research investigating Craigslist’s online rental housing market and, using new analyses, theorized the impacts of technology platform- mediated housing search. It described the uneven quantity and quality of online information correlated with neighborhood demographics, creating unequal housing information supplies based on where you search. This calls into question the ability of technology platforms to serve as utopian, democratizing, equalizing forces when they rely on human content creation and preexisting sociospatial relations."

    The authors find that "online platforms with user generated content do not automatically smooth information exchange, reduce information asymmetries, or attenuate entrenched sociospatial inequalities. Craigslist data do not capture all neighborhoods—nor the experiences of all renters—equally well. Importantly, Craigslist data alone do not allow policymakers to fully understand the experiences of renters searching for housing in lower income or minority neighborhoods."

  shortDescription: This case study presents analysis of data stewards practices from
    the implementation of data collaborative project Global Fishing Watch.
  annotation: |-
    Summary:

    "Summary: Global Fishing Watch, originally set up through a collaboration between Oceana, SkyTruth and Google, is an independent nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing responsible stewardship of our oceans through increased transparency in fishing activity and scientific research. Using big data processing and machine learning, Global Fishing Watch visualizes, tracks, and shares data about global fishing activity in near-real time and for free via their public map. To date, the platform tracks approximately 65,000 commercial fishing vessels globally. These insights have been used in a number of academic publications, ocean advocacy efforts, and law enforcement activities.

    "Data Collaborative Model: Based on the typology of data collaborative practice areas, Global Fishing Watch is an example of the data pooling model of data collaboration, specifically a public data pool. Public data pools co-mingle data assets from multiple data holders — including governments and companies — and make those shared assets available on the web. This approach enabled the data stewards and stakeholders involved in Global Fishing Watch to bring together multiple data streams from both public- and private-sector entities in a single location. This single point of access provides the public and relevant authorities with user-friendly access to actionable, previously fragmented data that can drive efforts to address compliance in fisheries and illegal fishing around the world.

    "Data Stewardship Approach: Global Fishing Watch also provides a clear illustration of the importance of data stewards. For instance, representatives from Google Earth Outreach, one of the data holders, played an important stewardship role in seeking to connect and coordinate with SkyTruth and Oceana, two important nonprofit environmental actors who were working separately prior to this initiative. The brokering of this partnership helped to bring relevant data assets from the public and private sectors to bear in support of institutional efforts to address the stubborn challenge of illegal fishing."

  shortDescription: In this paper, the authors "make the case for adaptive and principle-based
    governance of big data research [and] then outline six principles of adaptive
    governance (AFIRRM) for big data research and discuss key factors for their implementation
    into effective governance structures and processes."

    The authors argue that adaptive governance is "a suitable regulatory style for big data health research by proposing six governance principles to foster the development of appropriate structures and processes to handle critical aspects of big data health research."

    The six principles are adaptivity, flexibility, inclusiveness, responsiveness, reflexivity, and monitoring (AFIRRM).

    To encourage adoption of these principles the authors "have advanced AFIRRM as a viable model for the creation of regulatory tools in the space of big data health research. [Their] model is based on a careful analysis of regulatory scholarship vis-à-vis the key attributes of this type of research. [They] are currently undertaking considerable efforts to introduce AFIRRM to regulators, operators and organizations in the space of research or health policy."

  shortDescription: This article discusses the balance between maintaining data sovereignty
    and bolstering AI and machine learning enabled innovation.
  annotation: |-
    Abstract:

    "Ethical considerations and governance approaches of AI are at a crossroads. Either one tries to convey the impression that one can bring back a status quo ante of our given "onlife"-era [1,2], or one accepts to get responsibly involved in a digital world in which informational self-determination can no longer be safeguarded and fostered through the old fashioned data protection principles of informed consent, purpose limitation and data economy [3,4,6]. The main focus of the talk is on how under the given conditions of AI and machine learning, data sovereignty (interpreted as controllability [not control (!)] of the data subject over the use of her data throughout the entire data processing cycle [5]) can be strengthened without hindering innovation dynamics of digital economy and social cohesion of fully digitized societies. In order to put this approach into practice the talk combines a presentation of the concept of data sovereignty put forward by the German Ethics Council [3] with recent research trends in effectively applying the AI ethics principles of explainability and enforceability [4-9]."

    The authors conclude that:

    "The integration of expertise from behavioural science and computer science is essential to making algorithmic systems interpretable by a wide range of stakeholders, allowing people to exercise agency and ultimately building trust. Individuals and groups who distrust algorithms may be less likely to harness the potential benefits of new technology, and, in this sense, interpretability intimately relates to equity. Education is an integral part of making explanations effective. Recent studies found that individuals who are more familiar with AI fear it less, and are more optimistic about its potential societal impacts24. We share this cautious optimism, but predicate it on helping different stakeholders move beyond the extremes of unbounded techno-optimism and techno-criticism, and into a nuanced and productive conversation about the role of technology in society."

  annotation: |-
    The author examines existing data valuation framework and finds some gap in this practice, which are:

    "Task-specificness: The value of data depends on the task it helps to fulfill. For instance, if Alice’s medical record indicates that she has disease A, then her data will be more useful to predict disease A as opposed to other diseases.

    "Fairness: The quality of data from different sources varies dramatically. In the worst-case scenario, adversarial data sources may even degrade model performance via data poisoning attacks. Hence, the data value should reflect the efficacy of data by assigning high values to data which can notably improve the model’s performance.

    "Efficiency: Practical machine learning tasks may involve thousands or billions of data contributors; thus, data valuation techniques should be capable of scaling up.

    Based on this observation, the author discusses "a principled notion of data value and computationally efficient algorithms for data valuation."

  shortDescription: 'This paper addresses the lack of understanding in law and policy
    discourse pertaining to data interoperability, and subsequently, “explains the
    technical complexity of interoperability and its enablers, namely data standards
    and application programming interfaces.”

    '
  annotation: "Abstract: \n\nIn the current data access and sharing debate, data interoperability
    is widely proclaimed as being key for efficiently reaping the economic welfare
    enhancing effects of further data re-use. Although, we agree, we found that the
    current law and policy framework pertaining data interoperability was missing
    a groundworks analysis. Without a clear understanding of the notions of interoperability,
    the role of data standards and application programming interfaces (APIs) to achieve
    this ambition, and the IP and trade secrets protection potentially hindering it,
    any regulatory analysis within the data access discussion will be incomplete.
    Any attempt at untangling the role of data interoperability in the access and
    sharing regimes requires a thorough understanding of the underlying technology
    and a common understanding of the different notions of data interoperability.
    The paper firstly explains the technical complexity of interoperability and its
    enablers, namely data standards and application programming interfaces. It elaborates
    on the reasons data interoperability counts with different levels and puts emphasis
    on the fact that data interoperability is indirectly tangled to the data access
    right. Since data interoperability may be part of the legal obligations correlating
    to the access right, the scope of interoperability is and has already been subject
    to courts’ interpretation. While this may give some manoeuvre for balanced decision-making,
    it may not guarantee the ambition of efficient re-usability of data. This is why
    data governance market regulation under a public law approach is becoming more
    favourable. Yet, and this is elaborated in a second step, the paper builds on
    the assumption that interoperability should not become another policy on its own.
    This is followed by a competition economics assessment, taking into account that
    data interoperability is always a matter of degree and a lack of data interoperability
    does not necessarily lead to a market foreclosure of competitors and to causing
    harm to consumer welfare. Additionally, parts of application programming interfaces
    (APIs) may be protected under IP rights and trade secrets, which might conflict
    with data access rights. Instead of further solving the conflicting regimes within
    the respective legal regimes of the exclusive rights the paper concludes by suggesting
    that (sector-specific) data governance solutions should deal with this issue and
    align the different interests implied. This may provide for better, practical
    and well-balanced solutions instead of impractical and dysfunctional exceptions
    and limitations within the IP and trade secrets regimes. "

    \n"
  annotation: "Abstract: \n\nTo prevent the outbreak of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19),
    numerous countries around the world went into lockdown and imposed unprecedented
    containment measures. These restrictions progressively produced changes to social
    behavior and global mobility patterns, evidently disrupting social and economic
    activities. Here, using maritime traffic data, collected via a global network
    of Automatic Identification System (AIS) receivers, we analyze the effects that
    the COVID-19 pandemic and the containment measures had on the shipping industry,
    which accounts alone for more than 80% of the world trade. We introduce the notion
    of a \"maritime mobility index,\" a synthetic composite index, to quantitatively
    assess ship mobility in a given unit of time. The mobility index calculation used
    in this study, has a worldwide extent and is based on the computation of cumulative
    navigated miles (CNM) of all ships reporting their position and navigational status
    via AIS. We compare 2020 mobility levels to those of previous years assuming that
    an unchanged growth rate would have been achieved, if not for COVID-19. Following
    the outbreak, we find an unprecedented drop in maritime mobility, across all categories
    of commercial shipping. The reduced activity is observable from March to June,
    when the most severe restrictions were in force, producing a variation of mobility
    quantified between -5.62% and -13.77% for container ships, between +2.28% and
    -3.32% for dry bulk, between -0.22% and -9.27% for wet bulk, and between -19.57%
    and -42.77% for passenger shipping. The presented study is unprecedented for the
    uniqueness and completeness of the employed AIS dataset, which comprises a trillion
    AIS messages broadcast worldwide by 50000 ships, a figure that closely parallels
    the documented size of the world merchant fleet. "

    Abstract

    MIT CISR research has found that interorganizational data sharing is a top concern of companies; leaders often find data sharing costly, slow, and risky. Interorganizational data sharing, however, is requisite for new value creation in the digital economy. Digital opportunities require data sharing 2.0: cross-company sharing of complementary data assets and capabilities, which fills data gaps and allows companies, often collaboratively, to develop innovative solutions. This briefing introduces three sets of practices—curated content, designated channels, and repeatable controls—that help companies accelerate data sharing 2.0.

  annotation: |2-

    A shocking increase in violence against women and girls has been reported in many countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, amounting to what UN Women calls a “shadow pandemic.”

    The jarring facts are:

    - Globally 243 million women and girls have been subjected to sexual and/or physical violence by an intimate partner in the past 12 months.
    - The UNFPA estimates that the pandemic will cause a one-third reduction in progress towards ending gender-based violence by 2030;
    - UNFPA predicts an additional 15 million cases of gender-based violence for every three months of lockdown.
    - Official data captures only a fraction of the true prevalence and nature of gender-based violence.

    The response to these new challenges were discussed at a meeting in July with a community-led response delivered through local actors highlighted as key. This means that timely, disaggregated, community-level data on the nature and prevalence of gender-based violence has never been more important. Data collected within communities can play a vital role to fill the gaps and ensure that data-informed policies reflect the lived experiences of the most marginalized women and girls.

  annotation: |-
    Policymakers, experts and the general public heavily rely on the data that are being reported in the context of the coronavirus pandemic. Daily data releases on confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths provide information on the course of the pandemic. The same data are also essential for the estimation of indicators such as the reproduction rate and for the evaluation of policy interventions that seek to slow down the pandemic.

    Together with the proliferation of data, however, a number of pitfalls have arisen with regard to the interpretation of the data and the conclusions that can be drawn from them. The aim of this paper is to highlight the most common among these pitfalls given that they have the potential to intentionally or unintentionally mislead the public debate and thereby the course of future policy actions.

    The list of pitfalls presented is non-exhaustive. In fact, as the supply of data has increased since the beginning of the pandemic, new pitfalls have emerged in parallel, while others have decreased in relevance; a tendency that seems likely to continue into the future. Beyond explaining some of the current pitfalls, this paper will serve as a more general caveat regarding the interpretation of data in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

    societal challenges – "Financial inclusion, crisis response, resource conservation,
    public health, and climate change are all examples of data mega-use-cases encompassed
    by the SDGs. But data can only contribute to the solution of these problems if
    it is readily available and shared."

    Excerpt – 

    "Achieving most, if not all, of the UN’s 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) will require the use of data from multiple public and private sources. In this sense, the SDGs are the embodiment of what we call “data mega-use-cases”: complex problems and opportunities affecting many different individuals, companies, organizations, and governments. Financial inclusion, crisis response, resource conservation, public health, and climate change are all examples of data mega-use-cases encompassed by the SDGs. But data can only contribute to the solution of these problems if it is readily available and shared."

  shortDescription: '"An examination of the datafication of family life—in particular,
    the construction of our children into data subjects."'
  annotation: "From the summary: \n\n\"Our families are being turned into data, as
    the digital traces we leave are shared, sold, and commodified. Children are datafied
    even before birth, with pregnancy apps and social media postings, and then tracked
    through childhood with learning apps, smart home devices, and medical records.
    In Child Data Citizen, Veronica Barassi examines the construction of children
    into data subjects, describing how their personal information is collected, archived,
    sold, and aggregated into unique profiles that can follow them across a lifetime.
    Children today are the very first generation of citizens to be datafied from before
    birth, and Barassi points to critical implications for our democratic futures.\n\nBarassi
    draws on a three-year research project with parents in London and Los Angeles,
    which included the collection of fifty in-depth interviews, a digital ethnography
    of “sharenting” activities on social media by eight families over the course of
    eight months, and a two-year exploration of the datafication of her own family.
    She complements her ethnographic findings with a platform analysis of four social
    media platforms, ten health tracking apps, four home hubs, and four educational
    platforms, investigating the privacy policies, business models, and patent applications
    that enable the mining of children's data. Barassi considers the implications
    of building a society where data traces are made to speak for and about citizens
    across a lifetime. What should we do when we realize that the narratives that
    algorithms construct about individuals are inaccurate and biased?\""

  shortDescription: In this paper, the authors “find that Airbnb data (especially
    its unstructured part) appears to nowcast neighborhood gentrification, measured
    as changes in housing affordability and demographics.” Their results “suggest
    that user-generated data from online platforms can be used to create socioeconomic
    indices to complement traditional measures that are less granular, not in real-time,
    and more costly to obtain.”
  annotation: |-
    Abstract –

    "There is a rumbling debate over the impact of gentrification: presumed gentrifiers have been the target of protests and attacks in some cities, while they have been welcome as generators of new jobs and taxes in others. Census data fails to measure neighborhood change in real-time since it is usually updated every ten years. This work shows that Airbnb data can be used to quantify and track neighborhood changes. Specifically, we consider both structured data (e.g. number of listings, number of reviews, listing information) and unstructured data (e.g. user-generated reviews processed with natural language processing and machine learning algorithms) for three major cities, New York City (US), Los Angeles (US), and Greater London (UK). We find that Airbnb data (especially its unstructured part) appears to nowcast neighborhood gentrification, measured as changes in housing affordability and demographics. Overall, our results suggest that user-generated data from online platforms can be used to create socioeconomic indices to complement traditional measures that are less granular, not in real-time, and more costly to obtain."

    addition, our findings show that open government data is a trust-enabler for Millennials
    and Generation Z, not only through a direct link between both, but also thanks
    to the mediator role of citizens’ satisfaction. Accordingly, public officers are

  annotation: |-
    Abstract – 

    "While digital trace data from sources like search engines hold enormous potential for tracking and understanding human behavior, these streams of data lack information about the actual experiences of those individuals generating the data. Moreover, most current methods ignore or under-utilize human processing capabilities that allow humans to solve problems not yet solvable by computers (human computation). We demonstrate how behavioral research, linking digital and real-world behavior, along with human computation, can be utilized to improve the performance of studies using digital data streams. This study looks at the use of search data to track prevalence of Influenza-Like Illness (ILI). We build a behavioral model of flu search based on survey data linked to users’ online browsing data. We then utilize human computation for classifying search strings. Leveraging these resources, we construct a tracking model of ILI prevalence that outperforms strong historical benchmarks using only a limited stream of search data and lends itself to tracking ILI in smaller geographic units. While this paper only addresses searches related to ILI, the method we describe has potential for tracking a broad set of phenomena in near real-time."

  shortDescription: 'Building upon issues discussed in the C4DC report, “Laying the
    Foundation for Effective Partnerships: An Examination of Data Sharing Agreements,”
    this brief examines the potential of sunset clauses or sunset provisions to be
    a legally binding, enforceable, and accountable way of ensuring COVID-19 related
    data sharing agreements are wound down responsibly at the end of the pandemic.'
  annotation: |-
    The use of data and technology in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a range of new questions around how data should or should not be used; intellectual property rights; limitations on data re-use; how long data should be used for; and ultimately what should happen to collected data once the pandemic is over.

    "The brief is divided into four substantive parts and is rounded-off with concluding thoughts. Part I introduces sunset clauses as legislative tools, highlighting a number of examples of how they have been used in both COVID-19 related and other contexts. It also shows their potential value as a tool
    to eventually wind down the use of sensitive data to trace and track individuals. Part II discusses sunset provisions in the context of data sharing agreements and attempts to explain the complex interrelationship between data ownership, intellectual property, and sunset provisions. Building on this, Part III identifies some key issues policymakers should consider when assessing the utility and viability of sunset provisions within their data sharing agreements and arrangements. Finally, Part IV
    highlights the value of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) as a viable vehicle for sunset provisions in contexts where data sharing agreements are either non-existent or not regularly used."

    The three main findings of the paper are:
    • Sunset clauses could be effectively used in existing emergency power legislation to limit the risk of governments using sensitive data beyond the end of the pandemic.
    • There is an opportunity to introduce sunset provisions into legally binding agreements around data sharing as part of the COVID-19 response to help safeguard rights and limit the future use of personal data.
    • In contexts where data sharing agreements are not routinely used to set terms for data sharing, a memorandum of understanding between parties engaged in data sharing during the COVID-19 pandemic could be used to stipulate how sharing can be wound down.

  shortDescription: This project from TReNDS, the GovLab at New York University, University
    of Washington, and the World Economic Forum aims to shed light on the opportunities
    and challenges inherent to data collaboratives, and facilitate understanding of
    the written agreements that underpin them.
  annotation: "Excerpts:\n\n\"Contracts for Data Collaboration (C4DC) is a partnership
    between the Sustainable Development Solutions Network’s Thematic Research Network
    on Data and Statistics (SDSN TReNDS), the University of Washington’s (UW) Center
    for Information Assurance and Cybersecurity, the World Economic Forum (WEF), and
    the Governance Lab at New York University (“the GovLab”).\n\n\"The project aims
    to shed light on the opportunities and challenges inherent to data collaboratives.
    GovLab has worked to document the experiences of data collaboratives, specifically
    practices that involve the exchange of data or other data-related actions taking
    place between public and private entities (GovLab 2015). These exchanges and other
    data actions take place in various ways, from the informal sharing of insights
    and data-handling practices that don’t involve the sharing of raw data, through
    to more formal and legally-binding data sharing agreements (DSAs).  \n\n\"The
    project is directed towards a number of audiences. These span government data
    and information management professionals, statisticians, and policymakers, through
    to development and humanitarian organizations that rely on data to carry out their
    programs of work. Businesses, data producers, and data stewards considering sharing
    their data for public good and researchers and academics exploring the use and
    potential of data sharing agreements are also intended audiences. In this way,
    the C4DC partnership spans the data supply-and-demand landscape. \n\n\"The project
    aims to provide these groups and others with a range of tools to facilitate understanding
    of the opportunities and challenges related to formalized data sharing that is
    underpinned by written agreements. Project outputs will include an online repository
    of DSAs, together with an analytical framework that will help to demystify these
    types of agreements for non-legal professionals, raising their understanding of
    the issues involved in data sharing and related actions. In the medium-term, the
    project hopes to also produce and publish a series of case studies explaining
    when and how DSAs are, and should be, most effectively applied for maximum impact
    and with minimum risk in the public interest.\""

    Abstract:

    "A data collaboration in 2018 between the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS), Vodafone Ghana, and Flowminder, enabled the GSS to access insights from mobile phone data to plan public health and sustainable development policies. This case study demonstrates how a government and a private company were able to work with an intermediary partner to gain insights from sensitive data. As part of the collaboration, Vodafone Ghana provided access to pseudonymized telecommunications data free of charge, and Flowminder aggregated and analyzed the data on behalf of GSS. Initially, the parties had planned to form a non-binding agreement, but national regulators requested a formal agreement that addressed various data concerns. From the initial draft of the agreement provided by Vodafone Ghana to the final approval, negotiations took some 13 months. The negotiations were made especially challenging because GSS did not have its own legal counsel, and the process overlapped with the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Among other issues, the agreement addresses how the data will be aggregated, the parameters for the exchange of the data between the parties, data use limitations, data deletion, and the publication of analysis results. After signing the agreement in December 2018, the parties have since enjoyed a successful collaboration, and the mobile data being used by GSS has proven especially valuable during the current Covid-19 pandemic to document the impact of restriction measures in Ghana."

  shortDescription: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in new demands for data, in
    particular, there is growing interest in the use of mobile network operator (MNO)
    data for tracking population movement. In response to this, SDSN TReNDS on behalf
    of C4DC, has gathered and analyzed example data sharing agreements (DSAs) that
    have been used to share MNO data for health applications to help guide other data
    actors considering similar arrangements.
  annotation: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in new demands for data, and many
    countries are engaging in emergency data sharing arrangements to understand different
    dimensions of the health crisis. In particular, there is growing interest in the
    use of mobile network operator (MNO) data for tracking population movement. As
    described by Digital Impact Alliance, MNO data can be used to understand mobility
    patterns, predict new COVID-19 hotspots, model social distancing targets, and
    monitor health services. The inherent sensitivity of MNO data, however, raises
    privacy concerns, among other questions. GSMA - an international body representing
    the interests of more than 750 MNOs - has published COVID-19 privacy guidelines
    that address how its members can maintain trust while meeting requests from governments.
    The group Privacy International is also recording the ways that countries around
    the world are employing MNO data during the pandemic, and it has reported on situations
    where some of this data use might be illegal, such as the way Pakistan apparently
    accessed patients' registered mobile numbers without consent. Even under emergency
    conditions, MNO data sharing will have to be managed thoughtfully to realize the
    potential benefits without creating avoidable harm.

    "In 2013, the Government of Moldova and Development Gateway worked together to create an aid management platform to collect data from different development actors across the country. To accompany the platform, a data management plan (DMP) was established to provide guidelines for data submissions. The plan was first drafted by the government and Development Gateway, and it later incorporated feedback from various development actors and data providers. Most important, the plan was written as a flexible living document and supported by an accompanying law that increased the incentives for submitting data electronically. The DMP has proven effective for project implementation in Moldova, with development actors continuing to regularly submit data."

Although the collaboration involved publicly available data, the partners decided to form a memorandum of understanding, in part to show countries that the data was created through a partnership, and also to secure a long-term commitment to data sharing between Google and UN Environment. The agreement was kept general to provide flexibility, but it served to define the intent of the collaboration, commit to make data products publicly available, and indicate areas of primary responsibility, as well as to clarify the duration of the collaboration and to explain that there was no preferential treatment involved. The project was also enabled by a mutual spirit of cooperation and a collaboratively-developed work plan."

    From Abstract:

    This paper argues that the Global Indicator Framework required to support the 2030 Agenda Sustainable Development Goals will not be successfully populated, using only existing approaches and mechanisms. Official statistical systems must adapt and consider new approaches if only partial success is to be averted. This paper presents a proposal to accredit unofficial statistics as official for the purposes of compiling sustainable development goal indicators. While there may be some reluctance, and there are certainly risks with this proposal, the arguments put forward highlight the potential for collaboration. Keywords: 2030 Agenda, accreditation, risk management, fundamental principles of official statistics.

  shortDescription: This paper discusses “work carried out in partnership with Homeless
    Link (HL), a UK-based charity, in developing a data-driven approach to better
    connect people sleeping rough on the streets with outreach service providers.”
  annotation: "Abstract: \n\nRough sleeping is a chronic experience faced by some
    of the most disadvantaged people in modern society. This paper describes work
    carried out in partnership with Homeless Link (HL), a UK-based charity, in developing
    a data-driven approach to better connect people sleeping rough on the streets
    with outreach service providers. HL's platform has grown exponentially in recent
    years, leading to thousands of alerts per day during extreme weather events; this
    overwhelms the volunteer-based system they currently rely upon for the processing
    of alerts. In order to solve this problem, we propose a human-centered machine
    learning system to augment the volunteers' efforts by prioritizing alerts based
    on the likelihood of making a successful connection with a rough sleeper. This
    addresses capacity and resource limitations whilst allowing HL to quickly, effectively,
    and equitably process all of the alerts that they receive. Initial evaluation
    using historical data shows that our approach increases the rate at which rough
    sleepers are found following a referral by at least 15% based on labeled data,
    implying a greater overall increase when the alerts with unknown outcomes are
    considered, and suggesting the benefit in a trial taking place over a longer period
    to assess the models in practice. The discussion and modeling process is done
    with careful considerations of ethics, transparency, and explainability due to
    the sensitive nature of the data involved and the vulnerability of the people
    that are affected."

  shortDescription: "“This paper builds on the theoretical framework of visual cultures
    in urban planning and morphology to introduce and situate computational data science
    processes for exploring urban fabric patterns and spatial order.”\n"
  annotation: "Abstract: \n\n\"Urban planning and morphology have relied on analytical
    cartography and visual communication tools for centuries to illustrate spatial
    patterns, conceptualize proposed designs, compare alternatives, and engage the
    public. Classic urban form visualizations – from Giambattista Nolli’s ichnographic
    maps of Rome to Allan Jacobs’s figure-ground diagrams of city streets – have compressed
    physical urban complexity into easily comprehensible information artifacts. Today
    we can enhance these traditional workflows through the Smart Cities paradigm of
    understanding cities via user-generated content and harvested data in an information
    management context. New spatial technology platforms and big data offer new lenses
    to understand, evaluate, monitor, and manage urban form and evolution. This paper
    builds on the theoretical framework of visual cultures in urban planning and morphology
    to introduce and situate computational data science processes for exploring urban
    fabric patterns and spatial order. It demonstrates these workflows with OSMnx
    and data from OpenStreetMap, a collaborative spatial information system and mapping
    platform, to examine street network patterns, orientations, and configurations
    in different study sites around the world, considering what these reveal about
    the urban fabric. The age of ubiquitous urban data and computational toolkits
    opens up a new era of worldwide urban form analysis from integrated quantitative
    and qualitative perspectives.\""

  shortDescription: This paper advocates for a decentralized approach to contract
    tracing, “where both contact and location data are collected exclusively in individual
    citizens’ “personal data stores”, to be shared separately and selectively (e.g.,
    with a backend system, but possibly also with other citizens), voluntarily, only
    when the citizen has tested positive for COVID-19, and with a privacy preserving
    level of granularity. “
  annotation: "Abstract: \n\n\"The rapid dynamics of COVID-19 calls for quick and
    effective tracking of virus transmission chains and early detection of outbreaks,
    especially in the “phase 2” of the pandemic, when lockdown and other restriction
    measures are progressively withdrawn, in order to avoid or minimize contagion
    resurgence. For this purpose, contact-tracing apps are being proposed for large
    scale adoption by many countries. A centralized approach, where data sensed by
    the app are all sent to a nation-wide server, raises concerns about citizens’
    privacy and needlessly strong digital surveillance, thus alerting us to the need
    to minimize personal data collection and avoiding location tracking. We advocate
    the conceptual advantage of a decentralized approach, where both contact and location
    data are collected exclusively in individual citizens’ “personal data stores”,
    to be shared separately and selectively (e.g., with a backend system, but possibly
    also with other citizens), voluntarily, only when the citizen has tested positive
    for COVID-19, and with a privacy preserving level of granularity. This approach
    better protects the personal sphere of citizens and affords multiple benefits:
    it allows for detailed information gathering for infected people in a privacy-preserving
    fashion; and, in turn this enables both contact tracing, and, the early detection
    of outbreak hotspots on more finely-granulated geographic scale. The decentralized
    approach is also scalable to large populations, in that only the data of positive
    patients need be handled at a central level. Our recommendation is two-fold. First
    to extend existing decentralized architectures with a light touch, in order to
    manage the collection of location data locally on the device, and allow the user
    to share spatio-temporal aggregates—if and when they want and for specific aims—with
    health authorities, for instance. Second, we favour a longer-term pursuit of realizing
    a Personal Data Store vision, giving users the opportunity to contribute to collective
    good in the measure they want, enhancing self-awareness, and cultivating collective
    efforts for rebuilding society.\""

    Centre for International Governance Innovation collaboration to discuss data needs
    for a changing world: “To protect the data from increasing privacy risks, governance
    structures emerge to allow the use and sharing of data as necessary for innovation
    while addressing privacy risks. Two frameworks proposed to fulfill this purpose
    are data trusts and regulatory sandboxes.”'
  annotation: "Excerpt: \n\n\"The Government of Canada introduced the concept of “data
    trust” into the Canadian privacy law modernization discussion through Canada’s
    Digital Charter in Action: A Plan by Canadians, for Canadians, to “enable responsible
    innovation.” At a high level, a data trust may be defined, according to the Open
    Data Institute, as a legal structure that is appropriate to the data sharing it
    is meant to govern and that provides independent stewardship of data.\n\nBill
    C-11, known as the Digital Charter Implementation Act, 2020, and tabled on November
    17, 2020, lays the groundwork for the possibility of creating data trusts for
    private organizations to disclose de-identified data to specific public institutions
    for “socially beneficial purposes.” In her recent article “Replacing Canada’s
    20-Year-Old Data Protection Law,” Teresa Scassa provides a superb overview and
    analysis of the bill.\n\nAnother instrument for privacy protective innovation
    is referred to as the “regulatory sandbox.” The United Kingdom’s Information Commissioner’s
    Office (ICO) provides a regulatory sandbox service that encourages organizations
    to submit innovative initiatives without fear of enforcement action. From there,
    the ICO sandbox team provides advice related to privacy risks and how to embed
    privacy protection.\n\nBoth governance measures may hold the future of privacy
    and innovation, provided that we accept this equation: De-identified data may
    no longer be considered irrevocably anonymous and therefore should not be released
    unconditionally, but the risk of re-identification is so remote that the data
    may be released under a governance structure that mitigates the residual privacy
    risk.\""

  annotation: "Abstract: \n\n\"    In this chapter we argue that discourses on AI
    must transcend the language of 'ethics' and engage with power and political economy
    in order to constitute 'Good Data'. In particular, we must move beyond the depoliticised
    language of 'ethics' currently deployed (Wagner 2018) in determining whether AI
    is 'good' given the limitations of ethics as a frame through which AI issues can
    be viewed. In order to circumvent these limits, we use instead the language and
    conceptualisation of 'Good Data', as a more expansive term to elucidate the values,
    rights and interests at stake when it comes to AI's development and deployment,
    as well as that of other digital technologies. Good Data considerations move beyond
    recurring themes of data protection/privacy and the FAT (fairness, transparency
    and accountability) movement to include explicit political economy critiques of
    power. Instead of yet more ethics principles (that tend to say the same or similar
    things anyway), we offer four 'pillars' on which Good Data AI can be built: community,
    rights, usability and politics. Overall we view AI's 'goodness' as an explicly
    political (economy) question of power and one which is always related to the degree
    which AI is created and used to increase the wellbeing of society and especially
    to increase the power of the most marginalized and disenfranchised. We offer recommendations
    and remedies towards implementing 'better' approaches towards AI. Our strategies
    enable a different (but complementary) kind of evaluation of AI as part of the
    broader socio-technical systems in which AI is built and deployed.\""

    Excerpt:

    "Mobile phone surveys have been rapidly deployed by the World Bank to measure the impact of COVID-19 in nearly 100 countries across the world. Previous posts on this blog have discussed the sampling and  implementation challenges associated with these efforts, and coverage errors are an inherent problem to the approach. The survey methodology literature has shown mobile phone survey respondents in the poorest countries are more likely to be male, urban, wealthier, and more highly educated. This bias can stem from phone ownership, as mobile phone surveys are at best representative of mobile phone owners, a group which, particularly in poor countries, may differ from the overall population; or from differential response rates among these owners, with some groups more or less likely to respond to a call from an unknown number. In this post, we share our experiences in trying to improve representativeness and boost sample sizes for the poor in Papua New Guinea (PNG)."

    Abstract:

    Global cities are facing an almost unprecedented challenge of change. As they re-emerge from the Covid 19 pandemic and get ready to face climate change and other, potentially existential threats, they need to look for new ways to support wealth and wellbeing creation – leveraging Big Data and AI and suing them into their physical reality and to become greener, more inclusive and resilient, hence sustainable.

    This book describes how new digital technologies could be used to design digital and physical twins of cities that are able to feed into each other to optimize their working and ability to create new wealth and wellbeing. The book also describes how to increase cities’ social and economic resilience during crisis time and addressing their almost fatal weaknesses – as it became all too obvious during the recent COVID 19 crisis. Also, the book presents a framework for a critical discussion of the concept of “smart-city”, suggesting its development into a “cyber” and “meta” one – meaning, not only digital systems can allow physical ones (e.g. cities, citizens, households and companies) to become “smarter”, but also the vice versa is true, as off line data and real life behaviours can support the optimization and development of virtual brains as a sum of big data and artificial intelligence apps all sitting “over the cloud”.
    An analysis of the fundamental dynamics of this emerging “info-telligence” economy, and of the potential role of big digital players like Amazon, Google and Facebook is then paving the way to discuss a few strategic forays on how traditional sectors such as financial services, real estate, TMT or health could also evolve, leveraging Big Data and AI in a cyber-physical integrated setting. Finally, a number of thought provoking use cases that could be designed around individuals, and to improve the success and the resilience of households and companies living and working in urban areas are discussed, as an example of one of the most exciting future markets to come: the one of global, sustainable cities.

    Abstract:

    The paper presents and discusses the method adopted by Compagnia di San Paolo, one of the largest European philanthropic institutions, to monitor the advancement, despite the COVID-19 situation, in providing specific input to the decision-making process for dedicated projects. An innovative approach based on the use of daily open data was adopted to monitor the metropolitan area with a multidimensional perspective. Several open data indicators related to the economy, society, culture, environment, and climate were identified and incorporated into the decision support system
    dashboard. Indicators are presented and discussed to highlight how open data could be integrated into the foundation’s strategic approach and potentially replicated on a large scale by local institutions. Moreover, starting from the lessons learned from this experience, the paper analyzes the opportunities and critical issues surrounding the use of open data, not only to improve the quality of life during the COVID-19 epidemic but also for the effective regulation of society, the participation of citizens, and their well-being.

    control over the infrastructures that generate, shape, process, store, transfer,

    protected, and shared and is not always attuned to the salience of infrastructural

  annotation: |-
    Abstract:

    Data conveys significant social, economic, and political power. Unequal control over data — a pervasive form of digital inequality — is a problem for economic development, human agency, and collective self-determination that needs to be addressed. This paper takes some steps in this direction by analyzing the extent to which law facilitates unequal control over data and by suggesting ways in which legal interventions might lead to more equal control over data. By unequal control over data, we not only mean having or not having data, but also having or not having power over deciding what becomes and what does not become data. We call this the power to datafy. We argue that data inequality is in turn a function of unequal control over the infrastructures that generate, shape, process, store, transfer, and use data. Existing law often regulates data as an object to be transferred, protected, and shared and is not always attuned to the salience of infrastructural control over data. While there are no easy solutions to the variegated causes and consequences of data inequality, we suggest that retaining flexibility to experiment with different approaches, reclaiming infrastructural control, systematically demanding enhanced transparency, pooling of data and bargaining power, and differentiated and conditional access to data mechanisms may help in confronting data inequality more effectively going forward.

    technologies tend to be pitched for a particular context and purpose, but quickly

    it mean to “trade” personal data for the convenience of, say, an Amazon Echo,
    when the other side of that trade is constantly arranging new ways to sell and
    use that data in ways we cannot anticipate? As technology scholars Jake Goldenfein,
    Ben Green and Salomé Viljoen argue, the familiar trade-off of “privacy vs. X”
    rarely results in full respect for both values but instead tends to normalize
    a further stripping of privacy."

    “exponential increase” have seeped into everyday lexicon. Social media and news
    outlets have filled the public consciousness with trends, rankings and graphs
    throughout multiple waves of COVID-19.\n\nYet, the crisis also reveals a critical
    lack of data literacy amongst citizens in many parts of the world. The lack of
    a data literate culture predates the pandemic. The supply of statistics and information
    has significantly outpaced the ability of lay citizens to make informed choices
    about their lives in the digital data age.\n\nToday’s fragmented datafied information
    landscape is also susceptible to the pitfalls of misinformation, post-truth politics
    and societal polarisation – all of which demand a critical thinking lens towards
    data. There is an urgent need to develop data literacy at the level of citizens,
    organisations and society – such that all actors are empowered to navigate the
    complexity of modern data ecosystems.\n\nThe paper identifies three key take-aways.
    It is crucial to\n\n- forge a common language around data literacy\n- adopt a
    demand-driven approach and participatory approach to doing data literacy\n- move
    from ad-hoc programming towards sustained policy, investment and impact\n"

  shortDescription: This paper argues that there is a way in which local governments
    and other non-private sector stakeholders can access data from technology companies,
    “without harming the legitimate privacy interests of both individuals and companies.”
  annotation: |-
    Abstract:

    Cities in the US have started to enact data-sharing rules and programs to access some of the data that technology companies operating under their jurisdiction – like short-term rental or ride hailing companies - collect. This information allows cities to adapt too to the challenges and benefits of the digital information economy. It allows them to understand what their impact is on congestion, the housing market, the local job market and even the use of public spaces. It also empowers them to act accordingly by, for example, setting vehicle caps or mandating a tailored minimum pay for gig-workers. These companies, however, sometimes argue that sharing this information attempts against their users’ privacy rights and their privacy rights, because this information is theirs; it’s part of their business records. The question is thus what those rights are, and whether it should and could be possible for local governments to access that information to advance equity and sustainability, without harming the legitimate privacy interests of both individuals and companies. This Article argues that within current Fourth Amendment doctrine and privacy law there is space for data-sharing programs. Privacy law, however, is being mobilized to alter the distribution of power and welfare between local governments, companies, and citizens within current digital information capitalism to extend those rights beyond their fair share and preempt permissible data-sharing requests. The Article warns that if the companies succeed in their challenges, privacy law will have helped shield corporate power from regulatory oversight, while still leaving individuals largely unprotected and submitting local governments further to corporate interests.

  annotation: "\"Abstract: \n\n\"In January 2020, our first publication presented
    Authorized Public Purpose Access (APPA), a new data governance model that aims

    purposes, including fighting pandemics, be subject to appropriate and balanced
    governance mechanisms such as those set out the APPA approach. The same approach
    could be extended to the use of data for non-medical public-interest purposes,
    such as achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This
    publication proposes a systematic approach to implementing APPA and to pursuing

    Abstract:

    "Never has there been a more exciting time to be an official statistician. The data revolution is responding to the demands of the CoVID-19 pandemic and a complex sustainable development agenda to improve how data is produced and used, to close data gaps to prevent discrimination, to build capacity and data literacy, to modernize data collection systems and to liberate data to promote transparency and accountability. But can all data be liberated in the production and communication of official statistics? This paper explores the UN Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics in the context of eight new and big data sources. The paper concludes each data source can be used for the production of official statistics in adherence with the Fundamental Principles and argues these data sources should be used if National Statistical Systems are to adhere to the first Fundamental Principle of compiling and making available official statistics that honor citizen’s entitlement to public information."

  shortDescription: This paper describes challenges to the data-driven analyses of

  annotation: "Abstract: \n\n\"The recent surge of data-driven methods in social policy
    have created new opportunities to assess existing poverty programs. The expectation
    is that the combination of advanced methods and more data can calculate the effectiveness
    of public interventions more accurately and tailor local initiatives accordingly.
    Specifically, nonmonetary indicators are increasingly being measured at micro
    levels in order to target social exclusion in combination with poverty. However,
    the multidimensional character of poverty, local context, and data matching pose
    challenges to data-driven analyses. By linking Dutch household-level data with
    policy-initiative-specific data at local level, we present an explorative study
    on the uptake of a local poverty pass. The goal is to unravel pass usage in terms
    of household income and location as well as the age of users. We find that income
    and age play a role in whether the pass is used, and usage differs per neighborhood.
    With this, the paper feeds into the discourse on how to operationalize and design
    data matching work in the multidimensional space of poverty and nonmonetary government
    initiatives.\""

    From text:

    "Every child is different, with unique identities and their capacities and circumstances evolve over their lifecycle. Children are more vulnerable than adults and are less able to understand the long-term implications of consenting to their data collection. For these reasons, children’s data deserve to be treated differently.

    While responsible data use can underpin many benefits for children, ensuring that children are protected, empowered and granted control of their data is still a challenge.

    To maximise the benefits of data use for children and to protect them from harm requires a new model of data governance that is fitting for the 21st century.

    UNICEF has worked with 17 global experts to develop a Manifesto that articulates a vision for a better approach to children’s data.

    This Manifesto includes key action points and a call for a governance model purposefully designed to deliver on the needs and rights of children. It is the first step in ensuring that children’s rights are given due weight in data governance legal frameworks and processes as they evolve around the world."

    Abstract

    Background
    Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) is a well-established technique to elicit individual preferences, but it has rarely been used to elicit governance preferences for health data sharing.

    Objectives
    The aim of this article was to describe the process of identifying attributes for a DCE study aiming to elicit preferences of citizens in Sweden, Iceland and the UK for governance mechanisms for digitally sharing different kinds of health data in different contexts.

    Methods
    A three-step approach was utilised to inform the attribute and level selection: 1) Attribute identification, 2) Attribute development and 3) Attribute refinement. First, we developed an initial set of potential attributes from a literature review and a workshop with experts. To further develop attributes, focus group discussions with citizens (n = 13), ranking exercises among focus group participants (n = 48) and expert interviews (n = 18) were performed. Thereafter, attributes were refined using group discussion (n = 3) with experts as well as cognitive interviews with citizens (n = 11).

    Results
    The results led to the selection of seven attributes for further development: 1) level of identification, 2) the purpose of data use, 3) type of information, 4) consent, 5) new data user, 6) collector and 7) the oversight of data sharing. Differences were found between countries regarding the order of top three attributes. The process outlined participants’ conceptualisation of the chosen attributes, and what we learned for our attribute development phase.

    Conclusions
    This study demonstrates a process for selection of attributes for a (multi-country) DCE involving three stages: Attribute identification, Attribute development and Attribute refinement. This study can contribute to improve the ethical aspects and good practice of this phase in DCE studies. Specifically, it can contribute to the development of governance mechanisms in the digital world, where people's health data are shared for multiple purposes.

  title: Data Collaboratives to Improve Children’s Lives
  shortDescription: How can we leverage cross-sector data-sharing to improve the lives
    of children?
  longDescription: Recent years have seen exponential growth in the amount of data
    being generated and stored around the world. There is increasing recognition that
    this data can play a key role in solving some of the most difficult public problems
    we face – including problems facing children around the world. However, much of
    the potentially useful data is currently privately held and not available for
    public insights. Data in the form of web clicks, social “likes,” geolocation and
    online purchases are typically tightly controlled, usually by entities in the
    private sector. Companies today generate an ever-growing stream of information
    from our proliferating sensors and devices. Increasingly, they—and various other
    actors—are asking if there is a way to make this data available for the public
    good. There is an ongoing search for new models of corporate responsibility in
    the digital era around data toward the creation of “data collaboratives”.

  title: The Potential of Social Media Intelligence to Improve People's Lives
  shortDescription: Social Media Data for Good
  longDescription: |-
    The twenty-first century will be challenging on many fronts. From historically catastrophic natural disasters resulting from climate change to inequality to refugee and terrorism crises, it is clear that we need not only new solutions, but new insights and methods of arriving at solutions. Data, and the intelligence gained from it through advances in data science, is increasingly being seen as part of the answer. This report explores the premise that data—and in particular the vast stores of data and the unique analytical expertise held by social media companies—may indeed provide for a new type of intelligence that could help develop solutions to today’s challenges.

    In this report, developed with support from Facebook, we focus on an approach to extract public value from social media data that we believe holds the greatest potential: data collaboratives. Data collaboratives are an emerging form of public-private partnership in which actors from different sectors exchange information to create new public value. Such collaborative arrangements, for example between social media companies and humanitarian organizations or civil society actors, can be seen as possible templates for leveraging privately held data towards the attainment of public goals.

  title: Gender and Urban Mobility
  shortDescription: Leveraging data collaboratives to make urban transportation planning
    more gender-inclusive
  longDescription: "As part of the Data2X initiative, The GovLab, UNICEF, Universidad
    del Desarrollo/Telefónica R&D Center, ISI Foundation, and DigitalGlobe have joined
    forces to determine if gender plays a role in the way people move in megacities,
    and how transportation planning can become more gender-inclusive.\n\nSantiago,
    Chile, was selected as the first location for the multi-dimensional research study,
    and the multi-national team will use Data Collaboratives as the platform for aggregating
    and analyzing a mix of corporate and open government data around gender and urban
    mobility.\n\nGreater access to data on gender and urban mobility can inform regulations,
    policies and programs that help address real-world challenges experienced by women
    and children, and increase their safety and security. And Data Collaboratives
    offer a vehicle for understanding the intelligence gathered from public and private
    data sources to surface possible solutions. \n\nThe Santiago project team is creating
    a Data Collaborative on Gender and Urban Mobility to pair official government
    data (census, transport, crime report, socioeconomic indicators) with high-definition
    satellite imagery from DigitalGlobe, and aggregated, anonymized Call Detail Records
    from Telefonica to create create a human landscape and mobility map of Santiago.

  title: Contracts for Data Collaboration (C4DC)
  shortDescription: Addressing the inefficiencies of developing contractual agreements
    for public-private data collaboration
  longDescription: Contracts for Data Collaboration (C4DC) seeks to address the inefficiencies
    of developing contractual agreements for public-private data collaboration. The
    intent is to inform and guide those seeking to establish a data collaborative
    by developing and making available a shared repository of contractual clauses
    (taken from existing data sharing agreements) that covers a host of issues, including
    security and privacy concerns, access provisions and use limitations, and governance
    mechanisms, among others. In addition to the searchable library of contractual
    clauses, the repository will house use cases, guides and other information that
    analyse common patterns, language and best practices.

  title: Data Stewards Network
  shortDescription: Connecting responsible data leaders from the private sector seeking
    new ways to create public value through data collaboration
  longDescription: "To find new ways to lower the high transaction costs to establish
    Data Collaboratives, The GovLab — with generous support from the William and Flora
    Hewlett Foundation — is advancing the concept and practice of Data Stewardship
    to promote responsible data leadership that can address the challenges of the
    21st century.\n\nWe are:\n- Exploring the needs and priorities of current private
    sector Data Stewards who act as change agents within their firms. Responsible
    for determining what, when, how and with whom to share private data for public
    good, these individuals are critical catalysts for ensuring insights are turned
    into action. \n- Identifying and connecting existing Data Stewards across sectors
    and regions to create an online and in-person community for exchanging knowledge
    and best practices.\n- Developing methodologies, tools and frameworks to use data
    more responsibly, systematically and efficiently to decrease the transaction cost,
    time and energy currently needed to establish Data Collaboratives."

  title: Circular Data for a Circular City
  shortDescription: Facilitating economic development through the collection, production
    and exchange of data and business insights between public and private stakeholders
  longDescription: |-
    Circular Data for a Circular City: Value Propositions for Economic Development is The GovLab’s contribution to New Lab’s Circular City initiative and research journal.

    Looking at potential high-value use cases in Downtown Brooklyn, we explored how “circular data”—the collection, production, and exchange of data and business insights between public and private sector stakeholders—can facilitate economic development to benefit both government and business.

    Working with the City of New York and three “urban data” startups participating in New Lab’s Circular City program—CARMERA, Numina, and Citiesense—we developed a framework for thinking about the potential and realized value of circular data, identify and analyze 15 circular data-driven use cases, and reflect on the enabling conditions, challenges, and risks associated with the use of circular data.

    Circular data presents abundant opportunities for economic development, and it is our hope that this work informs future opportunities for businesses to work intelligently, collaboratively, and responsibly with city government in a manner that will advance sustainable data-driven partnerships.
