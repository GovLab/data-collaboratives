  whatDataShared: 'School districts that use Clever'' services can access a single,
    universal API that allows developers and education companies to access siloed
    data within a school’s student information system. '
  howDataShared: Originating from the Y-Combinator start-up accelerator program, Clever
    provides a standardized API platform for schools and tech developers. Unlike other
    data collaboratives, this means that Clever is a for-profit company that has emerged
    as people have identified the need for data and intelligence products to support
    schools and the public. Therefore, Clever does not generate its own data to share
    through Data Collaborative projects, but rather acts as an intemediary between
    students, schools, administrators and disctricts to share data in a safe and useful
    manner.
  purpose: 'In order to streamline student roster infromation from school databases,
    enabling schools to send student information easily to various web and mobile
    apps. Administrators can also choose whether to share this student information
    with school classes, school, or the entire district. This means administrators
    maintain control over the data shared, but also can easily share student data
    if they so choose. '

    This journal article explores the benefits and, in particular, the risks related to large-scale biomedical databases bringing together health information from a diversity of sources across sectors. Some data collaboratives examined in the piece include:
    - __MedMining__ – a company that extracts EHR data, de-identifies it, and offers it to researchers. The data sets that MedMining delivers to its customers include ‘lab results, vital signs, medications, procedures, diagnoses, lifestyle data, and detailed costs’ from inpatient and outpatient facilities.
    - __Explorys__ has formed a large healthcare database derived from financial, administrative, and medical records. It has partnered with major healthcare organizations such as the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and Summa Health System to aggregate and standardize health information from ten million patients and over thirty billion clinical events.

    Hoffman and Podgurski note that biomedical databases populated have many potential uses, with those likely to benefit including: “researchers, regulators, public health officials, commercial entities, lawyers,” as well as “healthcare providers who conduct quality assessment and improvement activities,” regulatory monitoring entities like the FDA, and “litigants in tort cases to develop evidence concerning causation and harm.”

    They argue, however, that risks arise based on:
    - The data contained in biomedical databases is surprisingly likely to be incorrect or incomplete;
    - Systemic biases, arising from both the nature of the data and the preconceptions of investigators are serious threats the validity of research results, especially in answering causal questions;
    - Data mining of biomedical databases makes it easier for individuals with political, social, or economic agendas to generate ostensibly scientific but misleading research findings for the purpose of manipulating public opinion and swaying policymakers.

  shortDescription: A white paper describing the potential of big data, and corporate
    data in particular, to positively benefit development efforts
  annotation: |-
    This white paper, produced by “a group of activists, researchers and data experts” explores the potential of big data to improve development outcomes and spur positive social change in low- and middle-income countries. Using examples, the authors discuss four areas in which the use of big data can impact development efforts:

    - Advocating and facilitating by “opening[ing] up new public spaces for discussion and awareness building;
    - Describing and predicting through the detection of “new correlations and the surfac[ing] of new questions;
    - Facilitating information exchange through “multiple feedback loops which feed into both research and action,” and
    - Promoting accountability and transparency, especially as a byproduct of crowdsourcing efforts aimed at “aggregat[ing] and analyz[ing] information in real time.

    The authors argue that in order to maximize the potential of big data’s use in development, “there is a case to be made for building a data commons for private/public data, and for setting up new and more appropriate ethical guidelines.”

    They also identify a number of challenges, especially when leveraging data made accessible from a number of sources, including private sector entities, such as:

    - Lack of general data literacy;
    - Lack of open learning environments and repositories;
    - Lack of resources, capacity and access;
    - Challenges of sensitivity and risk perception with regard to using data;
    - Storage and computing capacity; and
    - Externally validating data sources for comparison and verification.

    initiatives. Three “core contingencies’’ for successful collaborative governance
    initiatives identified by the authors are:\n\n- Time (e.g., decision making time
    afforded to the collaboration);\n- Interdependence (e.g., a high degree of interdependence
    can mitigate negative effects of low trust); and\n- Trust (e.g. a higher level
    of trust indicates a higher probability of success).\n"

  shortDescription: A Chatham House report describing the need for data sharing and
    collaboration for global public health emergencies and potential lessons learned
    from the commercial sector
  annotation: |-
    The Chatham House report provides an overview on public health surveillance data sharing, highlighting the benefits and challenges of shared health data and the complexity in adapting technical solutions from other sectors for public health.

    The report describes data sharing processes from several perspectives, including in-depth case studies of actual data sharing in practice at the individual, organizational and sector levels. Among the key lessons for public health data sharing, the report strongly highlights the need to harness momentum for action and maintain collaborative engagement: “Successful data sharing communities are highly collaborative. Collaboration holds the key to producing and abiding by community standards, and building and maintaining productive networks, and is by definition the essence of data sharing itself. Time should be invested in establishing and sustaining collaboration with all stakeholders concerned with public health surveillance data sharing.”

    Examples of data collaboratives include H3Africa (a collaboration between NIH and Wellcome Trust) and NHS England’s care.data programme.

  shortDescription: A paper proposing a decision model for data sharing arrangements
    aimed at addressing identified risks and challenges
  annotation: "This paper proposes a decision model for data sharing of public and
    private data based on literature review and three case studies in the logistics
    sector.\n\nThe authors identify five categories of the barriers to data sharing
    and offer a decision model for identifying potential interventions to overcome
    each barrier:\n\n- Ownership. Possible interventions likely require improving
    trust among those who own the data through, for example, involvement and support
    from higher management\n- Privacy. Interventions include “anonymization by filtering
    of sensitive information and aggregation of data,” and access control mechanisms
    built around identity management and regulated access.  \n- Economic. Interventions
    include a model where data is shared only with a few trusted organizations, and
    yield management mechanisms to ensure negative financial consequences are avoided.\n-
    Data quality. Interventions include identifying additional data sources that could
    improve the completeness of datasets, and efforts to improve metadata.\n- Technical.
    Interventions include making data available in structured formats and publishing
    data according to widely agreed upon data standards.\n"

  stepTitle: __Step 2:__ Define the value proposition of the data collaborative
  discussion: Research and practice in data collaboratives point to a number of societal
    benefits arising from the cross-sector sharing of data. After clearly defining
    the problem that a data collaborative will serve to address, organizers should
    look to gain specificity on the specific benefit a data collaborative could offer.
  questions: |
    What is the intended societal benefit of the data collaborative:
    - Accurate, real-time monitoring of situations?
    - Agile governance in policy making and public service delivery?
    - Evidence-based problem solving and decision making?
    - Improved anticipatory mechanisms for problems and opportunities?
    - Wider variety of problem solvers working collaboratively to solve complex problems?

    [The Namibia National Vector-borne Diseases Control Programme (NVDCP)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3927223/) used CDR data from telecommunications provider MTC Namibia, in combination with national surveillance data and satellite imagery, in order to analyze movement patterns for over a million people and map areas of malaria prevalence and risk. The results of the study helped the NVDCP in Namibia improve their targeting of malaria interventions to communities most at risk.

  stepTitle: __Step 4:__ Data Supply
  discussion: 'In many ways, data collaboratives are means for filling gaps in existing
    institutional data supplies. In order to fill such gaps, organizers should conduct
    an upfront audit of both the existing internal data supply and the potential supply
    of data existing in other sectors. Such an audit can help inform and prioritize
    outreach to external data holders and ensure that newly accessible datasets are
    well-positioned for filling the most important data gaps. '
  questions: |
    - Internal: Conduct due diligence research and a data audit
      1. What data currently exists that will be useful in addressing the problem?
      2. What are the data gaps that slow progress toward addressing the problem?

    - External: Map the potential supply side based on identified gaps
      1. What data do you already have (develop a data inventory)?
      2. Which entities (whether private, governmental or nongovernmental) possess and could provide the needed data?

  stepTitle: '__Step 3:__ Expertise: Data Science and Organizational Competency'
  discussion: "Cross-sector data sharing requires not only the bringing together or
    \ndiverse datasets, but also collaboration between people and organizations with
    different skills and institutional norms. An upfront understanding of how human
    and institutional capacity and cultures either do or do not mesh can help to define
    optimal roles and responsibilities and identify capacity gaps that need to be
    filled (through additional partnerships or other mechanisms)."
  questions: "- Internal\n\n  1. Evaluate and review internal capacity \n  2. Build
    high-level internal support\n  3. Identify internal data literacy and human capital
    \n  4. Collect and share examples of how other organizations have leveraged data\n\n-
    External \n  1. Which entities could provide additional competencies (data science
    and otherwise)?\n"

  stepTitle: __Step 1:__ Define the problem to be solved - TEST
  discussion: Gaining a clear sense of the problem you are seeking to solve is an
    essential first step in establishing a successful data collaborative. While defining
    the problem space might seem like a straightforward proposition, achieving the
    level of precision needed a well-targeted data collaborative requires an in-depth
    assessment of the problem space.
  questions: "1. Describe issue to be addressed\n2. Identify the beneficiaries \n3.
    Articulate why it matters\n4. Note any assumptions\n5. Explore current work to
    address the problem (internally and externally)"
