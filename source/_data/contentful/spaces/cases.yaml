  shortDescription: An issues paper from the Brookings Institution on leveraging the
    benefits of mobile phone data for humanitarian use while minimizing risks to privacy
  annotation: |-
    Using Ebola as a case study, the authors describe the value of using private telecom data for uncovering “valuable insights into understanding the spread of infectious diseases as well as strategies into micro-target outreach and driving update of health-seeking behavior.”

    The authors highlight the absence of a common legal and standards framework for “sharing mobile phone data in privacy-conscientious ways” and recommend “engaging companies, NGOs, researchers, privacy experts, and governments to agree on a set of best practices for new privacy-conscientious metadata sharing models.”

  shortDescription: A Chatham House report describing the need for data sharing and
    collaboration for global public health emergencies and potential lessons learned
    from the commercial sector
  annotation: |-
    The Chatham House report provides an overview on public health surveillance data sharing, highlighting the benefits and challenges of shared health data and the complexity in adapting technical solutions from other sectors for public health.

    The report describes data sharing processes from several perspectives, including in-depth case studies of actual data sharing in practice at the individual, organizational and sector levels. Among the key lessons for public health data sharing, the report strongly highlights the need to harness momentum for action and maintain collaborative engagement: “Successful data sharing communities are highly collaborative. Collaboration holds the key to producing and abiding by community standards, and building and maintaining productive networks, and is by definition the essence of data sharing itself. Time should be invested in establishing and sustaining collaboration with all stakeholders concerned with public health surveillance data sharing.”

    Examples of data collaboratives include H3Africa (a collaboration between NIH and Wellcome Trust) and NHS England’s care.data programme.

    aimed at addressing identified risks and challenges
  annotation: "This paper proposes a decision model for data sharing of public and
    private data based on literature review and three case studies in the logistics
    sector.\n\nThe authors identify five categories of the barriers to data sharing
    and offer a decision model for identifying potential interventions to overcome
    each barrier:\n\n- Ownership. Possible interventions likely require improving
    trust among those who own the data through, for example, involvement and support
    from higher management\n- Privacy. Interventions include “anonymization by filtering
    of sensitive information and aggregation of data,” and access control mechanisms
    built around identity management and regulated access.  \n- Economic. Interventions
    include a model where data is shared only with a few trusted organizations, and
    yield management mechanisms to ensure negative financial consequences are avoided.\n-
    Data quality. Interventions include identifying additional data sources that could
    improve the completeness of datasets, and efforts to improve metadata.\n- Technical.
    Interventions include making data available in structured formats and publishing
    data according to widely agreed upon data standards.\n"

  annotation: "This article describes collaborative arrangements that include public
    and private organizations working together and proposes a model for understanding
    an emergent form of public-private interaction informed by 137 diverse cases of
    collaborative governance.\n\nThe article suggests factors significant to successful
    partnering processes and outcomes include:\n\n- Shared understanding of challenges,\n-
    Trust building processes,\n- The importance of recognizing seemingly modest progress,
    and\n- Strong indicators of commitment to the partnership’s aspirations and process.
    \n\nThe authors provide a ‘’contingency theory model’’ that specifies relationships
    between different variables that influence outcomes of collaborative governance
    initiatives. Three “core contingencies’’ for successful collaborative governance
    initiatives identified by the authors are:\n\n- Time (e.g., decision making time
    afforded to the collaboration);\n- Interdependence (e.g., a high degree of interdependence
    can mitigate negative effects of low trust); and\n- Trust (e.g. a higher level
    of trust indicates a higher probability of success).\n"

  shortDescription: A white paper describing the potential of big data, and corporate
    data in particular, to positively benefit development efforts
  annotation: |-
    This white paper, produced by “a group of activists, researchers and data experts” explores the potential of big data to improve development outcomes and spur positive social change in low- and middle-income countries. Using examples, the authors discuss four areas in which the use of big data can impact development efforts:

    - Advocating and facilitating by “opening[ing] up new public spaces for discussion and awareness building;
    - Describing and predicting through the detection of “new correlations and the surfac[ing] of new questions;
    - Facilitating information exchange through “multiple feedback loops which feed into both research and action,” and
    - Promoting accountability and transparency, especially as a byproduct of crowdsourcing efforts aimed at “aggregat[ing] and analyz[ing] information in real time.

    The authors argue that in order to maximize the potential of big data’s use in development, “there is a case to be made for building a data commons for private/public data, and for setting up new and more appropriate ethical guidelines.”

    They also identify a number of challenges, especially when leveraging data made accessible from a number of sources, including private sector entities, such as:

    - Lack of general data literacy;
    - Lack of open learning environments and repositories;
    - Lack of resources, capacity and access;
    - Challenges of sensitivity and risk perception with regard to using data;
    - Storage and computing capacity; and
    - Externally validating data sources for comparison and verification.

    This journal article explores the benefits and, in particular, the risks related to large-scale biomedical databases bringing together health information from a diversity of sources across sectors. Some data collaboratives examined in the piece include:
    - __MedMining__ – a company that extracts EHR data, de-identifies it, and offers it to researchers. The data sets that MedMining delivers to its customers include ‘lab results, vital signs, medications, procedures, diagnoses, lifestyle data, and detailed costs’ from inpatient and outpatient facilities.
    - __Explorys__ has formed a large healthcare database derived from financial, administrative, and medical records. It has partnered with major healthcare organizations such as the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and Summa Health System to aggregate and standardize health information from ten million patients and over thirty billion clinical events.

    Hoffman and Podgurski note that biomedical databases populated have many potential uses, with those likely to benefit including: “researchers, regulators, public health officials, commercial entities, lawyers,” as well as “healthcare providers who conduct quality assessment and improvement activities,” regulatory monitoring entities like the FDA, and “litigants in tort cases to develop evidence concerning causation and harm.”

    They argue, however, that risks arise based on:
    - The data contained in biomedical databases is surprisingly likely to be incorrect or incomplete;
    - Systemic biases, arising from both the nature of the data and the preconceptions of investigators are serious threats the validity of research results, especially in answering causal questions;
    - Data mining of biomedical databases makes it easier for individuals with political, social, or economic agendas to generate ostensibly scientific but misleading research findings for the purpose of manipulating public opinion and swaying policymakers.

  whatDataShared: 23andMe shares its database of anonymized genetic data from more
    than 650,000 customers who decide to participate on the online medical studies.
    The ResearchKit app, developed in partnership with Apple, allows participants
    to integrate their genetic data  with large-scale medical studies.
  howDataShared: Medical studies initiated by partner institutions, like the Mount
    Sinai Asthma Health and Stanford Medicine's MyHeart Counts projects, can access
    23andMe research services through a new ResearchKit App, through which customers
    can choose to share data. Customers of 23andMe's services can also choose to participate
    in other surveys to aid medical research, and provide data to 23andMe's industry,
    academic and non-profit partners.
  purpose: The data collaborative allows research partners to quickly run queries
    on more than 1,000 diseases, conditions, and traits so that they can identify
    new associations between genetic markers using the 23andMe data. A single customer
    who chooses to opt into research contributes to over 230 studies on a variety
    of health topics. This effectively accelerates medical research, leading to significant
    discoveries in a fraction of the cost and time.

  whatDataShared: AMP partners focus on four diseases—Alzheimer's disease, type 2
    diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus--and
    share genomic and molecular data to accelerate research into disease treatmeant.
  howDataShared: All AMP partners have agreed to make the AMP data and analyses publicly
    accessible to the broad biomedical community through an online portal. AMP governs
    their projects through steering committees for each of the three disease areas,
    with representation from all partners. The steering committees are managed by
    the Foundation of the National Institute of Health (FNIH) under the direction
    of an AMP Executive Committee comprised of representatives from NIH, participating
    industry leaders, FDA, and non-profit organizations.
  purpose: The AMP initiative combines public-private expertise and pooled data to
    reduce the time and cost of developing biomarkers for disease treatment. The project
    attempts to overcome fragmentation in the pharmaceutical industry and improve
    innovation in drug therapy. By combining data, the AMP portal can find new drug
    targets, and reduces wasteful repetition of testing found when companies work
    in-silo.
