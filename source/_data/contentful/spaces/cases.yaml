  whatDataShared: This Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) project combines cell
    phone data from 15 million people in Kenya with detailed information on the regional
    incidence of malaria.
  howDataShared: "According to Havard University's press release, between June 2008
    and June 2009, researchers mapped every call or text made by each of 14,816,521
    Kenyan mobile phone subscribers to one of 11,920 cell towers located in 692 different
    settlements. Every time an individual left his or her primary settlement, the
    destination and duration of each journey was calculated. Then, using a 2009 malaria
    prevalence map provided by co-authors at the Kenya Medical Research Institute
    (KEMRI) and the Malaria Atlas Project to estimate the disease’s prevalence in
    each location being studied, they inferred each resident’s probability of being
    infected and the daily probability that visitors to particular areas would become
    infected. The phone company, Safari, provided de-identified business data to researchers
    that was then used to model the travel patterns of cell phone users. Neither the
    names of individuals nor their phone numbers were or are known to the Harvard
    School of Public Health researchers. \n"
  purpose: By analyzing the incidence of malaria and the movement of people as revealed
    by their mobile phones, researchers at HSPH and seven other institutions indicated
    that malaria, in large part, emanates from Kenya’s Lake Victoria region and spreads
    east, chiefly toward the capital, Nairobi. Such insights help estmate malaria's
    potential spread, and can be used to build a "map of parasite movements" and help
    better understand the spread of disease.

    digital assets to better inform and protect human health.
  howDataShared: 'The BD2K initiative encourages the broad use of biomedical digital
    assets by making them discoverable, accessible, and citable. In doing so, researchers
    need to take into account complex security issues, as Vivien Bonazzi, programme
    director in computational biology and bioinformatics at the National Human Genome
    Research Institute explains: "When a person consents to have his or her data used
    in one way, researchers cannot suddenly change that use, she says. In a big-data
    age that uses the cloud in addition to local hardware, new technologies in encryption
    and secure transmission will need to address such privacy concerns"'
  purpose: As biomedical datasets become increasingly large, diverse, and complex,
    they tax conventional methods for sharing, managing, and analyzing data. Additionally,
    researchers’ abilities to capitalize on biomedical big data science-based approaches
    are limited by poor data accessibility and interoperability, the lack of appropriate
    tools, and insufficient training. The BD2K initiative acts as a trans-NIH, community-enabled
    endeavor towards maximizing the collective value of current and future biomedical
    digital assets to better inform and protect human health. The aims of the BD2K
    initiative are to facilitate broad use of biomedical digital assets by making
    them discoverable, accessible, and citable; to conduct research and develop the
    methods, software, and tools needed to fully analyze biomedical big data; to enhance
    training in the development and use of methods and tools necessary for biomedical
    big data science; and to enable a data ecosystem that accelerates both basic and

    aimed to store, clean and aggregate student data for states and districts.
  howDataShared: InBloom was a nonprofit student data repository that made available
    standardized student and school data for creating approved third party applications
    and software designed for educators. It collected information from school districts'
    many databases, and stored these in the cloud, protected with high-level encryption.
    The inBloom database included more than 400 different data fields about students
    that school administrators could fill in. But, since some of the details seemed
    personal, like family relationships and enrollment changes, some parents objected,
    saying that they did not want that kind of information about their children transferred
    to a third-party vendor.

    Gates Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation of New York, InBloom aimed to store,
    clean and aggregate student data for states and districts, making data available
    and standardized for approved third party applications and software designed for

  purpose: Before the launch of the ECX in 2008, farmers struggled to find market
    price information, and often received prices far below market value – estimated
    on average to be just 35-38 percent of export price – and sometimes suffered serious
    losses when traders reneged on payment. The ECX aims to create transparent quality
    standards, allowing farmers to increase product quality and thereby the price

They offer clients "unprecedented insights about global trends." Orbital Insights describes its geoanlaytical process as one that comprises four key elements:
    - Imaging – Namely satellite imagery of the earth's surface.
    - Deep Learning – Algorithms that can "recgnoze objects, features, and patterns within images, generating highly intelligent and revealing data."
    - Cloud Computing – Orbital's data pipeline allows it to "process tens of thousands of pixels every second."
    - Data Science – In order to translate observations into actionable insights, Orbital leverages data science to contextualize and customize data for a variety of uses.

    using the results of its climate models to help farmers with their agricultural
    practices. Growers in the program also work alongside local extension officers
    to help other farmers understand and adopt the new strategies.  '
  purpose: The partnership provides information to growers and helps them improve
    their decision making about when to plant or not plant, as well as which varieties
    are most likely to have the best yields in the forecasted conditions. The site-specific
    information had an enormous economic impact. In 2013, when CSAC predicted a high
    risk of crop loss due to drought, farmers who did not plant saved $3.6 million
    in agricultural inputs that would have been spent on the failed crop.

  whatDataShared: 'Google Flu Trends launched in 2008 and provided estimates of influenza
    activity for more than 25 countries by aggregating Google search queries of relevant
    terms. Google shared these search query-based data in conjunction with the U.S.
    Centers for Disease Control in order to estimate levels of influenza activity
    over time. '
  howDataShared: The premise of Google Flu Trends was to combine data from the CDC
    with search terms containing flu-related information. Researchers proposed that
    these search data tuned into flu tracking information from the Centers for Disease
    Control and Prevention, could "nowcast" estimates of flu prevalence. But, the
    first version of Google Flu Trends was flawed in its data collection and modelling
    practices.  Its methodology was to find the best matches among 50 million search
    terms to fit 1152 data points. But, since the alogorithm was too broad and the
    big data often overfitted the case--for instance, mistakenly identifying seasonal
    search terms, like “high school basketball,” as flu predictions--Google Flu Trends
    missed 2013's peak flu season by 140 percent. The project now exists as a compilation
    of historical estimates, though it has also inspired several other similar projects
    that use social media data to predict disease trends.
  purpose: The goal of Google Flu Trends was to use search data to monitor health
    tracking behaviors online, and to reveal the presence of flu-like illness in a
    population. The intention was to identify disease activity early and respond quickly
    to reduce the impact of seasonal and pandemic influenza. One report was that Google
    Flu Trends was able to predict regional outbreaks of flu up to 10 days before
    they were reported by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). But,
    because of flaws in the project and analysis, none of these goals were attained
    to any sufficient standard.

    in data collaboratives as identified at the International Data Responsibility
    Conference.
  annotation: "This piece articulates a set of key lessons learned during a session
    at the International Data Responsibility Conference focused on identifying emerging
    practices, opportunities and challenges confronting data collaboratives.\n\nThe
    authors list a number of privately held data sources that could create positive
    public impacts if made more accessible in a collaborative manner, including:\n-
    Data for early warning systems to help mitigate the effects of natural disasters;\n-
    Data to help understand human behavior as it relates to nutrition and livelihoods
    in developing countries;\n- Data to monitor compliance with weapons treaties;\n-
    Data to more accurately measure progress related to the UN Sustainable Development
    Goals.\n \nTo the end of identifying and expanding on emerging practice in the
    space, the authors describe a number of current data collaborative experiments,
    including:\n- __Trusted Intermediaries__: Statistics Netherlands partnered with
    Vodafone to analyze mobile call data records in order to better understand mobility
    patterns and inform urban planning.\n- __Prizes and Challenges__: Orange Telecom,
    which has been a leader in this type of Data Collaboration, provided several examples
    of the company’s initiatives, such as the use of call data records to track the
    spread of malaria as well as their experience with Challenge 4 Development.\n-
    __Research partnerships__: The Data for Climate Action project is an ongoing large-scale
    initiative incentivizing companies to share their data to help researchers answer
    particular scientific questions related to climate change and adaptation.\n- __Sharing
    intelligence products__: JPMorgan Chase shares macro economic insights they gained
    leveraging their data through the newly established JPMorgan Chase Institute.\n\nIn
    order to capitalize on the opportunities provided by data collaboratives, a number
    of needs were identified:\n- A responsible data framework;\n- Increased insight
    into different business models that may facilitate the sharing of data;\n- Capacity
    to tap into the potential value of data;\n- Transparent stock of available data
    supply; and\n- Mapping emerging practices and models of sharing."

  shortDescription: A Chatham House report describing the need for data sharing and
    collaboration for global public health emergencies and potential lessons learned
    from the commercial sector.
  annotation: |
    This Chatham House report provides an overview on public health surveillance data sharing, highlighting the benefits and challenges of shared health data and the complexity in adapting technical solutions from other sectors for public health.

    The report describes data sharing processes from several perspectives, including in-depth case studies of actual data sharing in practice at the individual, organizational and sector levels. Among the key lessons for public health data sharing, the report strongly highlights the need to harness momentum for action and maintain collaborative engagement: “Successful data sharing communities are highly collaborative. Collaboration holds the key to producing and abiding by community standards, and building and maintaining productive networks, and is by definition the essence of data sharing itself. Time should be invested in establishing and sustaining collaboration with all stakeholders concerned with public health surveillance data sharing.”

    Examples of data collaboratives include H3Africa (a collaboration between NIH and Wellcome Trust) and NHS England’s care.data programme.

    The authors of this report provide a “systematic literature of potential barriers to public health data sharing.” These twenty potential barriers are classified in six categories: “technical, motivational, economic, political, legal and ethical.” In this taxonomy, “the first three categories are deeply rooted in well-known challenges of health information systems for which structural solutions have yet to be found; the last three have solutions that lie in an international dialogue aimed at generating consensus on policies and instruments for data sharing.”

    The authors suggest the need for a “systematic framework of barriers to data sharing in public health” in order to accelerate access and use of data for public good.

  shortDescription: A paper describing how data, such as privately held mobile phone
    data – could improve development policy.
  annotation: |-
    This journal article describes how privately held data – namely “digital traces” of consumer activity – “are becoming seen by policymakers and researchers as a potential solution to the lack of reliable statistical data on lower-income countries."

    They focus especially on three categories of data collaborative use cases:
    - Mobile data as a predictive tool for issues such as human mobility and economic activity;
    - Use of mobile data to inform humanitarian response to crises; and
    - Use of born-digital web data as a tool for predicting economic trends, and the implications these have for LMICs.

    They note, however, that a number of challenges and drawbacks exist for these types of use cases, including:
    - Access to private data sources often must be negotiated or bought, “which potentially means substituting negotiations with corporations for those with national statistical offices;”
    - The meaning of such data is not always simple or stable, and local knowledge is needed to understand how people are using the technologies in question
    - Bias in proprietary data can be hard to understand and quantify;
    - Lack of privacy frameworks; and
    - Power asymmetries, wherein “LMIC citizens are unwittingly placed in a panopticon staffed by international researchers, with no way out and no legal recourse.”

  shortDescription: An analysis of aggregated and anonymized call details records
    (CDR) conducted in collaboration with the UN, Government of Mexico, academia and
    Telefonica suggests high potential in using shared telecom data to improve early
    warning and emergency management mechanisms.
  annotation: |-
    This report describes the impact of using mobile data in order to understand the impact of disasters and improve disaster management. The report was conducted in the Mexican state of Tabasco in 2009 as a multidisciplinary, multi-stakeholder consortium involving the UN World Food Programme (WFP), Telefonica Research, Technical University of Madrid (UPM), Digital Strategy Coordination Office of the President of Mexico, and UN Global Pulse.

    Telefonica Research, a division of the major Latin American telecommunications company, provided call detail records covering flood-affected areas for nine months. This data was combined with “remote sensing data (satellite images), rainfall data, census and civil protection data.” The results of the data demonstrated that “analysing mobile activity during floods could be used to potentially locate damaged areas, efficiently assess needs and allocate resources (for example, sending supplies to affected areas).”

    In addition to the results, the study highlighted “the value of a public-private partnership on using mobile data to accurately indicate flooding impacts in Tabasco, thus improving early warning and crisis management.”

  shortDescription: A white paper describing the potential of big data, and corporate
    data in particular, to positively benefit development efforts.
  annotation: |-
    This white paper, produced by “a group of activists, researchers and data experts” explores the potential of big data to improve development outcomes and spur positive social change in low- and middle-income countries. Using examples, the authors discuss four areas in which the use of big data can impact development efforts:
    - Advocating and facilitating by “opening[ing] up new public spaces for discussion and awareness building;
    - Describing and predicting through the detection of “new correlations and the surfac[ing] of new questions;
    -  Facilitating information exchange through “multiple feedback loops which feed into both research and action,” and
    -  Promoting accountability and transparency, especially as a byproduct of crowdsourcing efforts aimed at “aggregat[ing] and analyz[ing] information in real time.

    The authors argue that in order to maximize the potential of big data’s use in development, “there is a case to be made for building a data commons for private/public data, and for setting up new and more appropriate ethical guidelines.”

    They also identify a number of challenges, especially when leveraging data made accessible from a number of sources, including private sector entities, such as:
    - Lack of general data literacy;
    - Lack of open learning environments and repositories;
    - Lack of resources, capacity and access;
    - Challenges of sensitivity and risk perception with regard to using data;
    - Storage and computing capacity; and
    - Externally validating data sources for comparison and verification.

  shortDescription: A case study examining the opening of private data by Dutch energy
    network administrator Liander.
  annotation: |
    This research has developed a monitoring framework to assess the effects of open (private) data using a case study of a Dutch energy network administrator Liander.

    Focusing on the potential impacts of open private energy data – beyond ‘smart disclosure’ where citizens are given information only about their own energy usage – the authors identify three attainable strategic goals:
    - Continuously optimize performance on services, security of supply, and costs;
    - Improve management of energy flows and insight into energy consumption;
    - Help customers save energy and switch over to renewable energy sources.

    The authors propose a seven-step framework for assessing the impacts of Liander data, in particular, and open private data more generally:
    - Develop a performance framework to describe what the program is about, description of the organization’s mission and strategic goals;
    - Identify the most important elements, or key performance areas which are most critical to understanding and assessing your program’s success;
    - Select the most appropriate performance measures;
    - Determine the gaps between what information you need and what is available;
    - Develop and implement a measurement strategy to address the gaps;
    - Develop a performance report which highlights what you have accomplished and what you have learned;
    - Learn from your experiences and refine your approach as required.

    While the authors note that the true impacts of this open private data will likely not come into view in the short term, they argue that, “Liander has successfully demonstrated that private energy companies can release open data, and has successfully championed the other Dutch network administrators to follow suit.”

    The paper presents a research study conducted on the basis of the mobile calls records shared with researchers in the framework of the Data for Development Challenge by the mobile operator Orange.

    The study discusses the data analysis approach in relation to developing a situation of Ebola diffusion built around “the interactions of multi-scale models, including viral loads (at the cellular level), disease progression (at the individual person level), disease propagation (at the workplace and family level), societal changes in migration and travel movements (at the population level), and mitigating interventions (at the abstract government policy level).”

    The authors argue that the use of their population, mobility, and simulation models provide more accurate simulation details in comparison to high-level analytical predictions and that the D4D mobile datasets provide high-resolution information useful for modeling developing regions and hard to reach locations.

  shortDescription: A journal article primarily focused on the risks involved in health
    data pooling.
  annotation: |-
    This journal article explores the benefits and, in particular, the risks related to large-scale biomedical databases bringing together health information from a diversity of sources across sectors. Some data collaboratives examined in the piece include:
    - __MedMining__ – a company that extracts EHR data, de-identifies it, and offers it to researchers. The data sets that MedMining delivers to its customers include ‘lab results, vital signs, medications, procedures, diagnoses, lifestyle data, and detailed costs’ from inpatient and outpatient facilities.
    - __Explorys__ has formed a large healthcare database derived from financial, administrative, and medical records. It has partnered with major healthcare organizations such as the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and Summa Health System to aggregate and standardize health information from ten million patients and over thirty billion clinical events.

    Hoffman and Podgurski note that biomedical databases populated have many potential uses, with those likely to benefit including: “researchers, regulators, public health officials, commercial entities, lawyers,” as well as “healthcare providers who conduct quality assessment and improvement activities,” regulatory monitoring entities like the FDA, and “litigants in tort cases to develop evidence concerning causation and harm.”

    They argue, however, that risks arise based on:
    - The data contained in biomedical databases is surprisingly likely to be incorrect or incomplete;
    - Systemic biases, arising from both the nature of the data and the preconceptions of investigators are serious threats the validity of research results, especially in answering causal questions;
    - Data mining of biomedical databases makes it easier for individuals with political, social, or economic agendas to generate ostensibly scientific but misleading research findings for the purpose of manipulating public opinion and swaying policymakers.

    Using Ebola as a case study, the authors describe the value of using private telecom data for uncovering “valuable insights into understanding the spread of infectious diseases as well as strategies into micro-target outreach and driving update of health-seeking behavior.”

    The authors highlight the absence of a common legal and standards framework for “sharing mobile phone data in privacy-conscientious ways” and recommend “engaging companies, NGOs, researchers, privacy experts, and governments to agree on a set of best practices for new privacy-conscientious metadata sharing models.”

  shortDescription: A paper proposing a decision model for data sharing arrangements
    aimed at addressing identified risks and challenges.
  annotation: "This paper proposes a decision model for data sharing of public and
    private data based on literature review and three case studies in the logistics
    sector.\n\nThe authors identify five categories of the barriers to data sharing
    and offer a decision model for identifying potential interventions to overcome
    each barrier:\n- __Ownership__. Possible interventions likely require improving
    trust among those who own the data through, for example, involvement and support
    from higher management\n- __Privacy__. Interventions include “anonymization by
    filtering of sensitive information and aggregation of data,” and access control
    mechanisms built around identity management and regulated access.  \n- __Economic__.
    Interventions include a model where data is shared only with a few trusted organizations,
    and yield management mechanisms to ensure negative financial consequences are
    avoided.\n- __Data quality__. Interventions include identifying additional data
    sources that could improve the completeness of datasets, and efforts to improve
    metadata.\n- __Technical__. Interventions include making data available in structured
    formats and publishing data according to widely agreed upon data standards."

  stepTitle: Data Science Expertise and Organizational Competency
  discussion: Cross-sector data sharing requires not only the bringing together of
    diverse datasets, but also collaboration between people and organizations with
    different skills and institutional norms. An upfront understanding of how human
    and institutional capacity and cultures either do or do not mesh can help to define
    optimal roles and responsibilities and identify capacity gaps that need to be
    filled (through additional partnerships or other mechanisms).
  questions: "##### Internal\n- Evaluate and review internal capacity \n- Build high-level
    internal support\n- Identify internal data literacy and human capital \n- Collect
    and share examples of how other organizations have leveraged data\n##### External
    \n- Which entities could provide additional competencies (data science and otherwise)?\n"

  stepTitle: Select the most promising potential supply-side data providers and identify
    specific incentives for them to participate
  discussion: When and why corporations contribute their data differs according to
    the context in which the data is being requested or shared, the question access
    to their data may answer and the corporate and legal culture of the firm. Different
    corporations also have different views regarding the expected benefits and risks
    from sharing their data. As such, when firms extend themselves and share their
    data they seek to satisfy a variety of motivations.
  questions: "##### What entities are best suited for filling identified data gaps
    and/or expertise?\n##### Why would different actors be motivated to collaborate?\n-
    *Reciprocity*: corporations may share their data with others for mutual benefit,
    especially gaining access to other data sources that may be important to their
    own business decisions. Some corporations may also reciprocate due to a sense
    of “giving back that was taken” from individuals and society-at-large.\n- *Research
    & insights*: opening up their data may generate new answers to particular questions
    providing companies insights that may not have been extracted otherwise. Just
    as with open source, sharing data (and in some cases algorithms) can enable corporations
    to tap into data analytical skills (often free labor) distributed beyond the boundaries
    of their own company. External users may interrogate the data in new ways and
    use the skills and methodologies not readily available in the company. It may
    also create the potential to identify and hire valuable talent that can emerge
    from data. In addition, these insights may enable companies to identify new niches
    for activity and to develop new business models.\n- *Reputation and public relations*:
    sharing data for public good may enhance a firm’s corporate image and reputation,
    potentially attracting new users and customers. It may also offer an opportunity
    to gain (free) media attention and increase visibility among certain decision
    makers and other audiences.\n- Revenue generation: opening up corporate data does
    not always have to be for free. Under some conditions, corporate data may be offered
    for sale, generating extra revenue for firms.\n- *Regulatory compliance*: sharing
    data can also help corporations comply with sectoral regulations and becoming
    more transparent and trusted. In addition, many corporations are generating data
    often for the sole purpose of regulatory compliance. Sharing and using that data
    in a responsible manner (see below regarding some of the risks of opening up data)
    for public and private beneficial ways may leverage more broadly the investment
    made to collect the data for a narrow purpose. \n- *Responsibility and corporate
    philanthropy*: finally, sharing corporate data achieves many of the goals sought
    by traditional corporate social responsibility or philanthropy, where a company
    derives value from socially responsible behavior not just because of the positive
    image such an activity produces, but because opening up data can also improve
    the competitive business environment within which the business operates."

    specifics of data-sharing process
  discussion: Upon completing the preceding steps, stakeholders in the data collaborative
    should possess a clear understanding of how the arrangement can be put into practice.
    With this upfront knowledge, the operational aspects of an effective data collaborative
    can be defined – with the understanding that specifics can and should be iterated
    upon as needed going forward.
  questions: "- What are the expectations of each of the entities, and how does the
    initiative align with the business (or, if relevant, philanthropic) mission of
    the participating private sector entity? \n- What is the management structure
    for the data collaborative? Who is responsible for stewarding the process?\n-
    Who are the champions in each participating entity? \n- What skills are required
    within the governing institution?\n- What information or data will be made open

  stepTitle: Define ideal type of data collaborative based on supply/demand
  discussion: 'Data collaboratives exist in a number of forms, each of which is better
    positioned for a certain problem or date type. The current field of practice shows
    that there are currently six main types of data collaboratives, the preceding
    steps in this canvas should help to make clear which of the following collaboration
    mechanisms is best-suited for the opportunity at hand.

'
  questions: "Given the insights gained during previous steps, which data collaborative
    type is best suited to the problem at hand?  \n- __Trusted Intermediary__, where
    companies share data with a limited number of known partners. Companies generally
    share data with these entities for data analysis and modeling, as well as other
    value chain activities. \n- __Prizes or Challenge__, in which companies make data
    available to qualified applicants who compete to develop new apps or discover
    innovative uses for the data. Companies typically host these contests in an effort
    to incentivize a wide range of civic hackers, pro-bono data scientists and other
    expert users to find innovative solutions with the available data.\n- __Research
    Partnership__, in which corporations share data with universities and other research
    organizations. Through partnerships with corporate data providers, several research
    organizations are conducting experiments using anonymized and aggregated samples
    of consumer datasets and other sources of data to analyze social trends.\n- __Intelligence
    Products__, where companies share (often aggregated) data that provides general
    insight into market conditions, customer demographic information, or other broad
    trends. \n- __Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)__, which allow developers
    and others to access data for testing, product development, and data analytics.
    By signing a terms of service agreement, companies give access to streams of its
    data in order to build applications.\n- __Corporate Data Cooperatives or Pooling__,
    in which corporations — and other important dataholders such as government agencies — group
    together to create “collaborative databases” with shared data resources. These
    collaborations typically require an organizing partner as well as technical and
    legal frameworks surrounding the use and distribution of the data."
  examples: |-
    - __Trusted Intermediary__: South Africa-based telecom MTN makes anonymized call records available to researchers through a trusted intermediary, Real Impacts Analytics — a data analytics firm that provides guided and predictive analytics solutions through its [Data for Good Program](http://datacollaboratives.org/cases/real-impact-analytics-data-for-good-program.html).
    - __Prizes or Challenges__: In Ivory Coast and Senegal, Orange Telecom hosted a global challenge – the [Orange Telecom Data for Development Challenge](http://datacollaboratives.org/cases/orange-telecom-data-for-development-challenge.html) – that allowed researchers to use anonymized, aggregated data to help solve various development problems, including those related to transportation, health, and agriculture.
    - __Research Partnership__: Yelp shares its data on neighborhood businesses with 30 universities for researchers to build tools and discover meaningful value in the data. Using shared data on Yelp businesses in the San Francisco Bay Area, an academic research team from U.C. Berkeley used a probabilistic model for natural language processing to detect subtopics across a dataset of over 200,000 Yelp business reviews. Their research uncovered correlations between positive ratings and service quality, giving business owners evidence for improving their services.
    - __APIs__: Facebook Open Graph Search allows for consumers and companies to mine social graphs for search query-based data, such as demographic and location data, “likes,” and multimedia. Companies such as Slate and Upworthy have used available data from Open Graph Search to optimize their headlines and increase readership.
    - __Corporate Data Cooperatives or Pooling__: Through its [Accelerating Medicines Partnership](http://datacollaboratives.org/cases/accelerating-medicines-partnership-amp.html), the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) is helping organize data pooling among the world’s largest biopharmaceutical companies in order to identify promising drug and diagnostic targets for Alzheimer’s disease.

  stepTitle: Measure progress against defined, agreed-upon metrics of success
  discussion: In order to measure progress throughout the lifespan of the data collaborative,
    ensure that mechanisms are in place for the consistent generation of data enabling
    assessment against the baseline. While much of the work of impact assessment is
    done at the start or conclusion of such an initiative, upfront efforts to create
    or gain access to data about progress throughout can help to inform iteration
    and improve the likelihood of success.

  discussion: Some data collaboratives are primarily or exclusively focused on improving
    the data capacity of participating institutions. Others, however, have additional,
    external audiences or user groups. Clearly defining the audience(s) and their
    needs can enable stakeholders to craft an information sharing approach that is
    well-suited to maximizing the usefulness of newly created data-driven offerings.
  questions: "- Who are the intended beneficiaries or user groups for the data collaborative?
    \n- Do the different user groups exist in different sectors?\n- Do the different
    user groups have divergent needs or introduce divergent challenges? \n- Is there
    a particular user group that should be prioritized?\n- What are the communication

  stepNumber: Step 7
  stepTitle: Assess major risks, ethical concerns and potential challenges
  discussion: The collection, processing, sharing, analysis and use of data introduce
    a number of risks and challenges for stakeholders involved in data collaboratives.
    Rather than seeking to mitigate the realized harms arising from those risks after
    the fact, stakeholders should seek to understand the risks at every stage of the
    data lifecycle in order to develop well-targeted strategies for mitigating them.
  questions: "##### Understand risks across the data lifecycle (with particular focus
    on the sharing and use stages)\n- **Collection**\n    - Collection of inaccurate
    or “dirty” data\n    - Unauthorized data collection\n    - Incomplete, non-representative
    sampling\n- **Analysis & Processing**\n    - Insufficient, outdated, or inflexible
    security provisions\n    - Aggregation/correlation of incomparable datasets\n
    \   - Lack of academic rigor\n    - Each of the above can heavily influence outcome
    of study or misrepresent the data\n- **Sharing**\n    - Incompatible cultural
    or institutional norms or expectations\n    - Lack of stewardship on both ends
    to ensure responsible sharing of personally identifiable information as it travels
    across cases and sectors\n    - Improper or unauthorized access to shared data\n
    \   - Conflicting legal jurisdictions and different levels of security\n- **Use**\n
    \   - Controversial or incongruous data usage\n    - Misinterpretation of data\n
    \   - Possible re-identification of individuals\n    - Decisional interference\n\n#####
    What are the relevant legal, political and cultural concerns\n- Ensuring proprietary
    data isn’t subject to Freedom of Information laws \n- Does the data collaborative
    (or the partner) raise any sensitive political concerns?\n- Does the collaboration
    comport with the cultural (and societal) expectations of all parties?\n\n#####
    List potential unintended consequences\n- Profiling and Discrimination\n- Entrenching
    Existing Biases and Power Dynamics\n\n##### Anticipate potential harms to corporations\n-
    Criminal or civil legal investigations and/or regulatory fines;\n- Loss of regulatory
    licenses, standards, certifications;\n- Reputational and industrial damages –
    impacting competitive positioning and advantage; \n    - share price and/or cost
    of capital;\n    - customer attrition rates;\n    - employee recruitment, productivity
    and retention\n- Overall increase in operating expenses \n- Anticipate potential
    operational challenges"

  stepTitle: Establish a Governance Structure
  discussion: Establishing a data collaborative requires a number of upfront efforts
    across stakeholder groups. The many decisions to be made and responsibilities
    present in such an arrangement, however, do not end at the implementation stage.
    An agreed upon governance structure for the lifespan of the data collaborative
    can help to ensure that the processes for making important decisions – whether,
    for example, related to new uses for datasets or unanticipated risks coming into
    view – are clearly defined and understood by all parties. In addition, for the
    effort to be seen as legitimate, the process of developing data collaborative
    policies needs to be collaboratively engaging and consulting with a variety of
    groups, including both private sector and impacted citizens. Such consultation
    is also part of identifying potential benefits and these steps can be brought
    together even though we distinguish between them here.
  questions: "- What will the data collaborative’s decision-making process and hierarchy
    be? \n- How can stakeholders create feedback loops to ensure that progress isn’t
    made in isolation?\n- How will concerns be acted upon? \n- What will the process
    be for taking the data collaborative in a new direction or abandoning it should
    it prove innefective?"

  discussion: Especially for data collaboratives where corporate data providers were
    incentivized to participate based on reputational benefits, communicating the
    objectives and (intended) impacts of the arrangement to the public can be important.
    In many cases, a high level of specificity in public communications may not be
    desirable, but promoting the existence of the data collaborative can spur interest
    and engagement among target audiences (including funders).

  discussion: Establishing a data collaborative is often less expensive than creating
    the mechanisms to generate and collect data that is already held elsewhere, but
    there are often costs involved – including human capital costs for data scientists
    and stewards. An upfront and realistic assessment of the likely costs of the arrangement
    can inform strategic funding decisions – whether a tiered pricing model for a
    B2C, B2B or B2G data collaborative or seeking support from philanthropic and/or
    governmental grantmakers.

  discussion: Gaining a clear sense of the problem you are seeking to solve is an
    essential first step in establishing a successful data collaborative. While defining
    the problem space might seem like a straightforward proposition, achieving the
    level of precision needed for a well-targeted data collaborative requires an in-depth
    assessment of the problem space. Zeroing in on the problem can be difficult. To
    pinpoint an actionable problem with a specific data collaboration solution rather
    than a vague issue, requires writing and re-writing a one page Problem Statement.
    The Problem Statement articulates the problem with precision and makes assumptions
    explicit. It asks and answers why the problem has not been solved yet. It might
    also address who is harmed by the existence of the problem and why and what are
    the root causes of the problem. It might take several drafts to strip down to
    a statement of an actionable problem and its causes. But undertaking this exercise
    – especially doing so collaboratively with the participation of the key stakeholders
    involved in the issue – will help to build consensus behind the implementation
    of the project.

  stepTitle: Data Supply
  discussion: 'In many ways, data collaboratives are means for filling gaps in existing
    institutional data supplies. In order to fill such gaps, organizers should conduct
    an upfront audit of both the existing internal data supply and the potential supply
    of data existing in other sectors. Such an audit can provide insight regarding
    the data relevant to your project, who has it, who needs it, and how it can be
    used to tackle the problem. Data audits can also help inform and prioritize outreach
    to external data holders and ensure that newly accessible datasets are well-positioned
    for filling the most important data gaps. Too often the assumption is that all
    data must be made available when only a few data points are needed. As part of
    the data inventory, other considerations may include assessing the reputation
    and reliability of those who have the data and those who want it in terms of security
    and data responsibility. In and of itself, undertaking the data inventory helps
    to mitigate risk by helping to develop strategies for how to use the data. A more
    detailed analysis by interdisciplinary experts may help to identify technical
    or procedural workarounds for seemingly difficult or expensive tasks. '
  questions: |
    ##### Internal: Conduct due diligence research and a data audit
    - What data currently exists that will be useful in addressing the problem?
    - What are the data gaps that slow progress toward addressing the problem?
    ##### External: Map the potential supply side based on identified gaps
    - Develop a data inventory – what data do you already have?
    - Which entities (whether private, governmental or nongovernmental) possess and could provide the needed data?
  examples: "- [The New York City Business Atlas](http://odimpact.org/case-united-states-new-york-city-business-atlas.html)
    was developed by the Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics (MODA) by bringing together
    open government data relevant to small businesspeople interested in opening physical
    locations in the city to inform their decisionmaking. Official datasets, however,
    did not provide a sense of the foot traffic in different areas of the city. To
    fill this gap, MODA partnered with Placemeter, a local startup that analyzes video
    imagery to understand pedestrian flows throughout the city.  \n"

  stepTitle: Define the value proposition of the data collaborative
  discussion: Research and practice in data collaboratives point to a number of societal
    benefits arising from the cross-sector sharing of data. After clearly defining
    the problem that a data collaborative will serve to address, organizers should
    look to gain specificity on the specific benefit a data collaborative could offer.
    Without assessing the value of the data collaborative, tradeoffs cannot later
    be measured. To understand whether the use of a corporate data is worthwhile despite
    the risks involved, and to find the proper steps to take that mitigate risk, it
    is important to evaluate the context for the use of the data. This might involve
    an assessment of the urgency of having access to the data. Is there a disaster
    relief component or other time sensitivity? If it is hard to define the problem
    or hard to define the value, it will be impossible to evaluate the success of
    any data project. To justify the risks and the potential liability that arises
    from using and analyzing corporate data requires having a clearly articulated
    benefit that can be measured.
  questions: |-
    What is the intended societal benefit of the data collaborative?

    stepTitle: Select the most promising potential supply-side data providers and
      identify specific incentives for them to participate
    discussion: When and why corporations contribute their data differs according
      to the context in which the data is being requested or shared, the question
      access to their data may answer and the corporate and legal culture of the firm.
      Different corporations also have different views regarding the expected benefits
      and risks from sharing their data. As such, when firms extend themselves and
      share their data they seek to satisfy a variety of motivations.
    questions: "##### What entities are best suited for filling identified data gaps
      and/or expertise?\n##### Why would different actors be motivated to collaborate?\n-
      *Reciprocity*: corporations may share their data with others for mutual benefit,
      especially gaining access to other data sources that may be important to their
      own business decisions. Some corporations may also reciprocate due to a sense
      of “giving back that was taken” from individuals and society-at-large.\n- *Research
      & insights*: opening up their data may generate new answers to particular questions
      providing companies insights that may not have been extracted otherwise. Just
      as with open source, sharing data (and in some cases algorithms) can enable
      corporations to tap into data analytical skills (often free labor) distributed
      beyond the boundaries of their own company. External users may interrogate the
      data in new ways and use the skills and methodologies not readily available
      in the company. It may also create the potential to identify and hire valuable
      talent that can emerge from data. In addition, these insights may enable companies
      to identify new niches for activity and to develop new business models.\n- *Reputation
      and public relations*: sharing data for public good may enhance a firm’s corporate
      image and reputation, potentially attracting new users and customers. It may
      also offer an opportunity to gain (free) media attention and increase visibility
      among certain decision makers and other audiences.\n- Revenue generation: opening
      up corporate data does not always have to be for free. Under some conditions,
      corporate data may be offered for sale, generating extra revenue for firms.\n-
      *Regulatory compliance*: sharing data can also help corporations comply with
      sectoral regulations and becoming more transparent and trusted. In addition,
      many corporations are generating data often for the sole purpose of regulatory
      compliance. Sharing and using that data in a responsible manner (see below regarding
      some of the risks of opening up data) for public and private beneficial ways
      may leverage more broadly the investment made to collect the data for a narrow
      purpose. \n- *Responsibility and corporate philanthropy*: finally, sharing corporate
      data achieves many of the goals sought by traditional corporate social responsibility
      or philanthropy, where a company derives value from socially responsible behavior
      not just because of the positive image such an activity produces, but because
      opening up data can also improve the competitive business environment within
      which the business operates."

'
    questions: "Given the insights gained during previous steps, which data collaborative
      type is best suited to the problem at hand?  \n- __Trusted Intermediary__, where
      companies share data with a limited number of known partners. Companies generally
      share data with these entities for data analysis and modeling, as well as other
      value chain activities. \n- __Prizes or Challenge__, in which companies make
      data available to qualified applicants who compete to develop new apps or discover
      innovative uses for the data. Companies typically host these contests in an
      effort to incentivize a wide range of civic hackers, pro-bono data scientists
      and other expert users to find innovative solutions with the available data.\n-
      __Research Partnership__, in which corporations share data with universities
      and other research organizations. Through partnerships with corporate data providers,
      several research organizations are conducting experiments using anonymized and
      aggregated samples of consumer datasets and other sources of data to analyze
      social trends.\n- __Intelligence Products__, where companies share (often aggregated)
      data that provides general insight into market conditions, customer demographic
      information, or other broad trends. \n- __Application Programming Interfaces
      (APIs)__, which allow developers and others to access data for testing, product
      development, and data analytics. By signing a terms of service agreement, companies
      give access to streams of its data in order to build applications.\n- __Corporate
      Data Cooperatives or Pooling__, in which corporations — and other important
      dataholders such as government agencies — group together to create “collaborative
      databases” with shared data resources. These collaborations typically require
      an organizing partner as well as technical and legal frameworks surrounding
      the use and distribution of the data."

      - __Prizes or Challenges__: In Ivory Coast and Senegal, Orange Telecom hosted a global challenge – the [Orange Telecom Data for Development Challenge](http://datacollaboratives.org/cases/orange-telecom-data-for-development-challenge.html) – that allowed researchers to use anonymized, aggregated data to help solve various development problems, including those related to transportation, health, and agriculture.
      - __Research Partnership__: Yelp shares its data on neighborhood businesses with 30 universities for researchers to build tools and discover meaningful value in the data. Using shared data on Yelp businesses in the San Francisco Bay Area, an academic research team from U.C. Berkeley used a probabilistic model for natural language processing to detect subtopics across a dataset of over 200,000 Yelp business reviews. Their research uncovered correlations between positive ratings and service quality, giving business owners evidence for improving their services.
      - __APIs__: Facebook Open Graph Search allows for consumers and companies to mine social graphs for search query-based data, such as demographic and location data, “likes,” and multimedia. Companies such as Slate and Upworthy have used available data from Open Graph Search to optimize their headlines and increase readership.
      - __Corporate Data Cooperatives or Pooling__: Through its [Accelerating Medicines Partnership](http://datacollaboratives.org/cases/accelerating-medicines-partnership-amp.html), the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) is helping organize data pooling among the world’s largest biopharmaceutical companies in order to identify promising drug and diagnostic targets for Alzheimer’s disease.

    discussion: The collection, processing, sharing, analysis and use of data introduce
      a number of risks and challenges for stakeholders involved in data collaboratives.
      Rather than seeking to mitigate the realized harms arising from those risks
      after the fact, stakeholders should seek to understand the risks at every stage
      of the data lifecycle in order to develop well-targeted strategies for mitigating
      them.

      outdated, or inflexible security provisions\n    - Aggregation/correlation of
      incomparable datasets\n    - Lack of academic rigor\n    - Each of the above
      can heavily influence outcome of study or misrepresent the data\n- **Sharing**\n
      \   - Incompatible cultural or institutional norms or expectations\n    - Lack
      of stewardship on both ends to ensure responsible sharing of personally identifiable
      information as it travels across cases and sectors\n    - Improper or unauthorized
      access to shared data\n    - Conflicting legal jurisdictions and different levels

      Misinterpretation of data\n    - Possible re-identification of individuals\n
      \   - Decisional interference\n\n##### What are the relevant legal, political
      and cultural concerns\n- Ensuring proprietary data isn’t subject to Freedom
      of Information laws \n- Does the data collaborative (or the partner) raise any
      sensitive political concerns?\n- Does the collaboration comport with the cultural
      (and societal) expectations of all parties?\n\n##### List potential unintended
      consequences\n- Profiling and Discrimination\n- Entrenching Existing Biases
      and Power Dynamics\n\n##### Anticipate potential harms to corporations\n- Criminal
      or civil legal investigations and/or regulatory fines;\n- Loss of regulatory
      licenses, standards, certifications;\n- Reputational and industrial damages
      – impacting competitive positioning and advantage; \n    - share price and/or
      cost of capital;\n    - customer attrition rates;\n    - employee recruitment,
      productivity and retention\n- Overall increase in operating expenses \n- Anticipate
      potential operational challenges"

    stepTitle: Develop a multi-faceted risk mitigation strategy
    discussion: Armed with a better understanding of the risks present in a data collaborative,
      organizers can develop strategies and responsibility frameworks to help mitigate
      those risks before they have real-world consequences.
    questions: "- Prioritize risks according to their likelihood of becoming reality
      and the severity of the harms they would create. \n- Consider alternative mechanisms
      or datasets that would not introduce the same level of risk.\n- Study how similar
      uses of data by other entities were either successful or unsuccessful in mitigating
      risks (e.g., through anonymization, data security techniques)\n- Ensure all
      stakeholders are in agreement regarding the ways in which risks will be mitigated,
      and the priority placed on mitigating especially salient risks\n- Continue to
      monitor risks and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies throughout the
      lifespan of the data collaborative"

    stepTitle: Establish a Governance Structure
    discussion: Establishing a data collaborative requires a number of upfront efforts
      across stakeholder groups. The many decisions to be made and responsibilities
      present in such an arrangement, however, do not end at the implementation stage.
      An agreed upon governance structure for the lifespan of the data collaborative
      can help to ensure that the processes for making important decisions – whether,
      for example, related to new uses for datasets or unanticipated risks coming
      into view – are clearly defined and understood by all parties. In addition,
      for the effort to be seen as legitimate, the process of developing data collaborative
      policies needs to be collaboratively engaging and consulting with a variety
      of groups, including both private sector and impacted citizens. Such consultation
      is also part of identifying potential benefits and these steps can be brought
      together even though we distinguish between them here.
    questions: "- What will the data collaborative’s decision-making process and hierarchy
      be? \n- How can stakeholders create feedback loops to ensure that progress isn’t
      made in isolation?\n- How will concerns be acted upon? \n- What will the process
      be for taking the data collaborative in a new direction or abandoning it should
      it prove innefective?"

  phaseDescription: Once the demand side of the equation is well understood and articulated,
    the supply of data and expertise (i.e., human capital) should be explored in order
    to determine how the supply can address the demand (or if there is not a match
    between supply and demand and, therefore, a data collaborative would be unconducive
    to the issue at hand).

    stepTitle: Data Science Expertise and Organizational Competency
    discussion: Cross-sector data sharing requires not only the bringing together
      of diverse datasets, but also collaboration between people and organizations
      with different skills and institutional norms. An upfront understanding of how
      human and institutional capacity and cultures either do or do not mesh can help
      to define optimal roles and responsibilities and identify capacity gaps that
      need to be filled (through additional partnerships or other mechanisms).
    questions: "##### Internal\n- Evaluate and review internal capacity \n- Build
      high-level internal support\n- Identify internal data literacy and human capital
      \n- Collect and share examples of how other organizations have leveraged data\n#####
      External \n- Which entities could provide additional competencies (data science
      and otherwise)?\n"

    stepTitle: Data Supply
    discussion: 'In many ways, data collaboratives are means for filling gaps in existing
      institutional data supplies. In order to fill such gaps, organizers should conduct
      an upfront audit of both the existing internal data supply and the potential
      supply of data existing in other sectors. Such an audit can provide insight
      regarding the data relevant to your project, who has it, who needs it, and how
      it can be used to tackle the problem. Data audits can also help inform and prioritize
      outreach to external data holders and ensure that newly accessible datasets
      are well-positioned for filling the most important data gaps. Too often the
      assumption is that all data must be made available when only a few data points
      are needed. As part of the data inventory, other considerations may include
      assessing the reputation and reliability of those who have the data and those
      who want it in terms of security and data responsibility. In and of itself,
      undertaking the data inventory helps to mitigate risk by helping to develop
      strategies for how to use the data. A more detailed analysis by interdisciplinary
      experts may help to identify technical or procedural workarounds for seemingly
      difficult or expensive tasks. '
    questions: |
      ##### Internal: Conduct due diligence research and a data audit
      - What data currently exists that will be useful in addressing the problem?
      - What are the data gaps that slow progress toward addressing the problem?
      ##### External: Map the potential supply side based on identified gaps
      - Develop a data inventory – what data do you already have?
      - Which entities (whether private, governmental or nongovernmental) possess and could provide the needed data?
    examples: "- [The New York City Business Atlas](http://odimpact.org/case-united-states-new-york-city-business-atlas.html)
      was developed by the Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics (MODA) by bringing together
      open government data relevant to small businesspeople interested in opening
      physical locations in the city to inform their decisionmaking. Official datasets,
      however, did not provide a sense of the foot traffic in different areas of the
      city. To fill this gap, MODA partnered with Placemeter, a local startup that
      analyzes video imagery to understand pedestrian flows throughout the city.  \n"

  phaseTitle: Implementation
  phaseDescription: 'By stage five, all parties should have a clear understanding
    of how the arrangement will work, the key risks and strategies for addressing
    them, and the processes that will ensure the data collaborative runs as expected.
    At the implementation stage, the data collaborative is launched, but only after
    expectations, roles, timeline and cost questions are answered. As with any product
    launch, the creation of a data collaborative requires thinking about what will
    happen, when, by whom and in what order. To cross the chasm from idea to implementation
    and, for example, to persuade others to take the steps necessary to embark on
    a new plan of action, you must be able to draft an implementation memo that lays
    out the steps of the project from data sharing to use to analysis to evaluation.
    The memo also needs to address the resources that need to be secured for the data
    collaborative to become sustainable. This goes beyond mere financial budgeting
    to include physical, human, data assets and cultural conditions needed to be successful. '

    stepTitle: Agree upon expectations, roles, responsibilities, timeline and operational
      specifics of data-sharing process
    discussion: Upon completing the preceding steps, stakeholders in the data collaborative
      should possess a clear understanding of how the arrangement can be put into
      practice. With this upfront knowledge, the operational aspects of an effective
      data collaborative can be defined – with the understanding that specifics can
      and should be iterated upon as needed going forward.
    questions: "- What are the expectations of each of the entities, and how does
      the initiative align with the business (or, if relevant, philanthropic) mission
      of the participating private sector entity? \n- What is the management structure
      for the data collaborative? Who is responsible for stewarding the process?\n-
      Who are the champions in each participating entity? \n- What skills are required
      within the governing institution?\n- What information or data will be made open
      to the public\n- Other partners that need to be engaged?"

    stepNumber: Step 12
    stepTitle: 'Determine Resources: Cost and Funding Models'
    discussion: Establishing a data collaborative is often less expensive than creating
      the mechanisms to generate and collect data that is already held elsewhere,
      but there are often costs involved – including human capital costs for data
      scientists and stewards. An upfront and realistic assessment of the likely costs
      of the arrangement can inform strategic funding decisions – whether a tiered
      pricing model for a B2C, B2B or B2G data collaborative or seeking support from
      philanthropic and/or governmental grantmakers.
