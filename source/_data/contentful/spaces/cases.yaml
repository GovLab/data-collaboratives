  howDataShared: Originating from the Y-Combinator start-up accelerator program, Clever
    provides a standardized API platform for schools and tech developers. Unlike other
    Data Collaboratives, this means that Clever is a for-profit company that has emerged
    as people have identified the need for data and intelligence products to support
    schools and the public. Therefore Clever does not generate its own data to share
    through Data Collaborative projects, but rather acts as an intermediary between
    students, schools, administrators and districts to share data in a safe and useful
    manner.
  purpose: 'By streamlining student roster information from school databases, schools
    are enabled to send student information easily to various web and mobile apps.
    Administrators can also choose whether to share this student information with
    specific classes, the school, or the entire district. This means administrators
    maintain control over the data shared but can easily share student data if they
    so choose. '

    y Sector Agropecuario Colombiano (Colombian Climate and Agricultural Sector; CSAC)
    provides meteorological data to farmers along with data on the economics and agronomy
    of rice cultivation.
  howDataShared: 'The CSAC works directly with growers interested in adopting new
    strategies, using the results of its climate models to help farmers with their
    agricultural practices. Growers in the program also work alongside local extension
    officers to help other farmers understand and adopt the new strategies.  '
  purpose: The partnership provides information to growers and helps them improve
    their decision making about when to plant or not plant as well as which varieties
    are most likely to have the best yields in the forecasted conditions. The site-specific
    information had an enormous economic impact. In 2013, when the CSAC predicted
    a high risk of crop loss due to drought, farmers who did not plant saved $3.6
    million in agricultural inputs that would have been spent on the failed crop.

  purpose: Nearly 200,000 SIMs that were present in Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince
    when the earthquake struck were no longer in the city as of 19 days post-earthquake.
    Just under a third of Port-au-Prince's residents were mobile phone subscribers
    at the time of the earthquake so this movement of SIMs equates to the movement
    of 630,000 people. With this information researchers were able to better understand
    the needs and response of victims of the earthquake and to better plan relief

    by requesting pick-up at a specific location.
  purpose: The Digital Matatus project helped passengers discover more efficient commuting
    routes. The new dataset will also help regulate bus stop locations; the project
    found that many buses stop erratically along the road to pick up passengers, with
    detrimental effects on traffic. The data collected by this project is also the

  whatDataShared: The Global Forest Watch (GFW) collects crowdsourced and geographical
    data to track environmental degradation, particularly deforestation, around the
    world. Its ArcGIS Online portal is an analytical tool that allows users to use
    this forest data in a GIS cloud environment. ArcGIS Online resources include thousands
    of authoritative datasets, references, and thematic maps about hundreds of topics.
    Users can also contribute to GFW by sharing data and stories from the ground via
    GFW’s crowdsourcing tools, blogs, and discussion groups. Special “apps” provide
    detailed information for companies that wish to reduce the risk of deforestation
    in their supply chains, users who want to monitor fires across Southeast Asia,
    and more.
  howDataShared: "Data on Global Forest Watch come from a variety of sources including
    governments, NGOs, academia, and industry. To acquire new data they research and
    incorporate available open data, form partnerships to move data into the public
    domain, and fund the creation of datasets to fill key gaps in their database.
    \ Generally, the process begins with a conversation between GFW and the data provider
    about which data sets will be visualized. The data provider will then be asked
    to sign a Data Sharing Agreement, which gives Global Forest Watch permission to
    visualize the data on the website and (in most cases) make the data downloadable.
    \n"
  purpose: |-
    In its Data Playbook, Global Forest Watch lists three central intended impacts:

    -"Improve the accuracy or timeliness of forest change detection.
    -Illustrate drivers of change, including land use and industrial activity. Priority sectors include logging, mining, agricultural commodities (palm oil, beef, soy, etc.), and infrastructure.
    -Indicate the health or status of remaining forests, such as biodiversity, landscape connectivity, or carbon.”

    The ultimate goal is to allow a wide array of stakeholders to provide data and track deforestation in an effort to campaign for change and more sustainable environmental practices.

    activity in more than 25 countries by aggregating Google search queries of relevant
    terms. Google shared these search query-based data in conjunction with the U.S.
    Centers for Disease Control in order to estimate levels of influenza activity
    over time. '
  howDataShared: The premise of Google Flu Trends was to combine data from the CDC
    with search terms containing flu-related information. Researchers proposed that
    these search data, tuned into flu tracking information from the Centers for Disease
    Control and Prevention, could "nowcast" estimates of flu prevalence. But the first
    version of Google Flu Trends was flawed in its data collection and modeling practices.  Its
    methodology was to find the best matches among 50 million search terms to fit
    1152 data points. Since the algorithm was too broad and the big data often over
    fitted the case - for instance, mistakenly identifying seasonal search terms like
    “high school basketball” as flu predictions - Google Flu Trends missed 2013's
    peak flu season by 140 percent. The project now exists as a compilation of historical
    estimates, though it has also inspired several other similar projects that use
    social media data to predict disease trends.
  purpose: The goal of Google Flu Trends was to use search data to monitor health
    tracking behaviors online, and to reveal the presence of flu-like illness in a
    population. The intention was to identify disease activity early and respond quickly
    to reduce the impact of seasonal and pandemic influenza. One report was that Google
    Flu Trends was able to predict regional outbreaks of flu up to 10 days before
    they were reported by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). But,
    because of flaws in the project and analysis, none of these goals were attained
    to any sufficient standard.

  whatDataShared: This Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) project combines cell
    phone data from 15 million people in Kenya with detailed information on the regional
    incidence of malaria.
  howDataShared: "According to Harvard University's press release, between June 2008
    and June 2009 researchers mapped every call or text made by each of 14,816,521
    Kenyan mobile phone subscribers to one of 11,920 cell towers located in 692 different
    settlements. Every time an individual left his or her primary settlement, the
    destination and duration of each journey was calculated. Then, using a 2009 malaria
    prevalence map provided by co-authors at the Kenya Medical Research Institute
    (KEMRI) and the Malaria Atlas Project to estimate the disease’s prevalence in
    each location being studied, they inferred each resident’s probability of being
    infected and the daily probability that visitors to particular areas would become
    infected. The phone company, Safaricom, provided de-identified business data to
    researchers that was then used to model the travel patterns of cell phone users.
    Neither the names of individuals nor their phone numbers were or are known to
    the Harvard School of Public Health researchers. \n"
  purpose: By analyzing the incidence of malaria and the movement of people as revealed
    by their mobile phones, researchers at HSPH and seven other institutions indicated
    that malaria, in large part, emanates from Kenya’s Lake Victoria region and spreads
    east, chiefly toward the capital, Nairobi. Such insights help estimate malaria's
    potential spread and can be used to build a "map of parasite movements" and help
    better understand the spread of disease.

  whatDataShared: Initiated in 2011 through $100 million in seed money from the Bill
    and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation of New York, inBloom
    aimed to store, clean and aggregate student data for states and districts.
  howDataShared: InBloom was a nonprofit student data repository that made available
    standardized student and school data for creating approved third party applications
    and software designed for educators. It collected information from school districts'
    many databases and stored these in the cloud protected with high-level encryption.
    The inBloom database included more than 400 different data fields about students
    that school administrators could fill in. But, since some of the details seemed
    personal, like family relationships and enrollment changes, some parents objected
    saying that they did not want that kind of information about their children transferred
    to a third-party vendor. InBloom ultimately collapsed, for a variety of reason,
    but mainly because the data sharing agreements were seen as a dangerous encroachment
    into students' education. A 2017 article (https://points.datasociety.net/inblooms-collapse-undermined-personalized-learning-and-data-standards-efforts-199c5cccac01#.a69staljc)
    drawn from a detailed report about inBloom (https://datasociety.net/pubs/ecl/InBloom_feb_2017.pdf)
    suggested that "For many on the ground, inBloom was nothing more than another
    example of rich tech elites projecting their values onto their communities with
    no contextual understanding."
  purpose: InBloom aimed to store, clean and aggregate student data for states and
    districts making data available and standardized for approved third party applications
    and software designed for educators. Backlash came from increased privacy concerns
    from parents and educators over the collection, use and storage of personally
    identifiable information on students, causing many partners to back out of initial
    agreements. InBloom began ending its services in April 2014.

    movements of two million anonymous mobile phones in Haiti in order to track population
    movements following the disaster.
  howDataShared: Digicel Haiti provided Flowminder and other organizations anonymized
    data on the position of 1.9 million SIMs in Haiti from 42 days before the 2010
    earthquake to 158 days afterwards. Nearly 200,000 SIMs that were present in Haiti's
    capital Port-au-Prince when the earthquake struck were no longer in the city 19
    days post-earthquake. Just under a third of Port-au-Prince's inhabitants were
    mobile phone subscribers at the time of the earthquake, so this movement of SIMs
    equates to the movement of 630,000 people.
  purpose: Through this collaboration with Digicel Haiti, Flowminder was able to analyze
    the movement of two million anonymous mobile phones in Haiti that corresponded
    closely to the real mobility of the population after the earthquake. This data
    provided critical support to the UN and other relief agencies and also helped
    predict post-earthquake population displacement patterns. This research and information
    will allow other organizations to better prepare relief activities even before
    natural disasters strike.

  whatDataShared: In November 2014 the National Institute of Health (NIH) launched
    the Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative as a trans-NIH, community-enabled
    endeavor towards maximizing the collective value of current and future biomedical
    digital assets to better inform and protect human health.
  howDataShared: 'The BD2K initiative encourages the broad use of biomedical digital
    assets by making them discoverable, accessible and citable. In doing so, researchers
    need to take into account complex security issues. As Vivien Bonazzi, programme
    director in computational biology and bioinformatics at the National Human Genome
    Research Institute, explains: "When a person consents to have his or her data
    used in one way, researchers cannot suddenly change that use... In a big-data
    age that uses the cloud in addition to local hardware, new technologies in encryption
    and secure transmission will need to address such privacy concerns"'
  purpose: As biomedical datasets become increasingly large, diverse and complex,
    they tax conventional methods for sharing, managing and analyzing data. Additionally,
    researchers’ abilities to capitalize on biomedical big data science-based approaches
    are limited by poor data accessibility and interoperability, the lack of appropriate
    tools, and insufficient training. The BD2K initiative acts as a trans-NIH, community-enabled
    endeavor towards maximizing the collective value of current and future biomedical
    digital assets to better inform and protect human health. The aims of the BD2K
    initiative are to facilitate broad use of biomedical digital assets by making
    them discoverable, accessible and citable; to conduct research and develop the
    methods, software and tools needed to fully analyze biomedical big data; to enhance
    training in the development and use of methods and tools necessary for biomedical
    big data science; and to enable a data ecosystem that accelerates both basic and

  whatDataShared: Researchers used satellite and cell phone data to map how malaria
    spreads throughout Namibia and show where elimination efforts have the greatest
    impact.
  howDataShared: To reconstruct travel patterns, Namibia’s largest network provider,
    Mobile Telecommunications Limited, shared anonymized cell phone records of 1.2
    million users from 2010-11 with researchers at the Flowminder Foundation and the
    University of Southampton in the United Kingdom. As calls are made, the locations
    of the cell towers through which signals pass are recorded. Call frequencies and
    locations then allow researchers to create detailed maps of human movement.
  purpose: The project's use of phone records aimed to track and eliminate malaria
    in Namibia. As a result of their work, researchers were able to identify and provide
    bed nets to the 80,000 people most important to the malaria transmission cycle
    in 2013.

  whatDataShared: In October 2014 Twitter committed $10 million towards the creation
    of MIT Media Lab’s Laboratory for Social Machines (LSM), providing full access
    to its real-time public stream and entire archive of tweets. Today, MIT's LSM
    acquires data from a number of digital networks to provide insights and research
    into a number of fields.
  howDataShared: |-
    LSM was initially launched by former Twitter Chief Media Scientist Deb Roy, who consequently gained complete access to all tweets (real-time and historical) from Twitter. Considering this close relationship between LSM and Twitter, guidelines (https://socialmachines.media.mit.edu/139-2/) have subsequently been formed to separate the interests of the social media platform and the academic institution.
    Though other digital networks are mentioned in LSM's projects, the data sharing agreements between LSM and other social media platforms are unknown.
  purpose: Social Machines hosts a number of research projects that aim to map and
    analyze social systems and to design tools to support the positive use of human
    networks. This includes research in the fields of Journalism and Public Opinion,
    Responsive Governance and Human Development. Previous projects include the analysis
    of tweets from the 2016 presidential campaign to scrutinize public opinion; creating
    a digital literacy learning program informed by social network designs; and the
    Human Atlas that analyzes social connections within communities.

    ride data based on much smaller geographic areas.
  purpose: Uber shares aggregate data on travel patterns at the zip code level with
    the City of Boston in order to provide new insights to city officials on urban
    growth, traffic congestion, public transportation and climate change. This data
    assists policy makers and city planners in developing more detailed accounts of

    Agencies, cities, and water retailers can volunteer to be a part of the CaDC and contribute to building a new data infrastructure for water management in California. The CaDC has non-profit status, and the data analytics tools it creates are drawn from open source software.

    Team ARGO, a collection of civic computational and statistical talent, was contracted to build, operate and maintain a new water data platform. This platform provides interactive analytics and data to CaDC utility providers and academic partners. Though this underlying data is not shared publicly, the code powering those tools is made open source where possible on the CaDC Github.
  purpose: The CaDC's goal is to integrate California's water data into a state-wide
    platform to provide accurate technical analysis to better inform water policy
    and operational decision making. The project works to support water managers who
    partner with CaDC with tools and analytics and provide a public service for the
    people of California. In 2017 on International Open Data day the CaDC further
    targeted this goal by hosting a Day of Action. Water rate data of 400 water utility
    companies was analyzed in order to standardize the information they publish so

    and user data collected via the Beeline app, which can then represent "community
    demand" information. In doing so Beeline crowdsources transportation insights
    directly from the passengers using the service.
  howDataShared: Transportation data is collected via the Beeline app when users sign-on
    and request rides. Beeline also collects crowdsourced route information from users
    through a feedback function. These "user suggested routes" are created when there
    is a large enough demand for this route.
  purpose: 'Beeline attempts to close the gap between commuters'' needs and the services
    offered by private bus companies by providing a feedback mechanism within the
    app. Their goal is to create a more responsive and efficient transport system
    by "crowdsourcing" bus services. The service has also led to the creation of [GrabShuttle](https://www.grab.com/sg/shuttle/)

  whatDataShared: The European Commission's Data Challenge on Integration of Migrants
    in Cities (D4I) provides data from a spatial disaggregation of statistics from
    the 2011 Census from eight European Union National Statistical Institutes. Data
    on residents' countries of origin have been provided from Spain, Germany, Italy,
    France, Netherlands, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and Ireland. The original data
    was spacially processed, and shows regions divided into uniform grids that show
    concentrations of migrants in cells of 100 by 100 meters. Each country has a separate
    data file available with the number of persons by origin in each grid cell. Data
    is also available from a dedicated data visualization platform.
  howDataShared: 'Data for the D4I Challenge is available worldwide to reseachers
    affiliated with a research institution that works with migration, spatial demography,
    social geography, urban sociology, economics, and political science. Eligible
    researchers are required to submit a proposal with the scope, objectives and intended
    use of the derived data. If selected, datasets are made available for download
    and analysis. Findings will be published in EU policymaker workshops and online
    in November 2018. '
  purpose: 'Through the Data Challenge on Integration of Migrant in Cities, the European
    Commission seeks to stimulate research on various aspects of migrant integration
    at the local level, especially if the research results in policy recommendations
    with European Union relevance. Through the offer of this census derived data,
    there is potential to strenghthen existing qualitiative research around urban
    diversity, spatial segregation, education, housing, access to public services,
    income, and electoral outcomes. '

    > "Privacy is central to our process, which therefore limits the data we work with, protects the data when we’re doing analysis, and restricts our use of any data to this study only. We designed the study with Twitter in a way that allows us to evaluate the experiment without needing to know the names or other personal information of any account. When the study finishes, Twitter will prepare an aggregated dataset for our analysis. Data from Twitter will remain on an encrypted system of ours where we will conduct our analysis, and we will not share the data beyond that system. After confirming the integrity of the data we receive, we will follow the agreed plan to analyze the results. Since peer review can take time, and since other researchers may ask us to double-check details, we will hold the data and any backups for two years after the study concludes, and then delete it all."
  purpose: The purpose of this study is to test whether having an explicit platform
    rules and norms will influence the way people behave on social media and reduce
    online abuse.

  eventDescription: |-
    On Sunday, September 24th, 2017, we will reconvene our community to deepen our mutual understanding. The theme for this year’s edition will be “__With Great Data comes Great Responsibility__,” or how data science can be applied to solve public interest problems without losing its soul.

    The data revolution has enabled businesses to provide better service, at lower cost, and to more customers, at a scale and rate of change not seen since the industrial revolution. In contrast to the corporate sector, the public and non-profit sectors have seen significantly less application of data science methods.

    Since 2014, Bloomberg has hosted the annual D4GX conference on the application of data science to solve problems for the social good. This forum enables data scientists from academia, industry and public sector actors from government and NGOs to build relationships, share insights and progress, and encourages them to work together on applying modern machine learning and data science methods to challenges in the public and non-profit sectors.

  stepNumber: Step 1
  stepTitle: 'Define the problem to be solved '
  discussion: Gaining a clear sense of the problem you are seeking to solve is an
    essential first step in establishing a successful data collaborative. While defining
    the problem space might seem like a straightforward proposition, achieving the
    level of precision needed for a well-targeted data collaborative requires an in-depth
    assessment of the problem space. Zeroing in on the problem can be difficult. To
    pinpoint an actionable problem with a specific data collaboration solution rather
    than a vague issue, requires writing and re-writing a one page Problem Statement.
    The Problem Statement articulates the problem with precision and makes assumptions
    explicit. It asks and answers why the problem has not been solved yet. It might
    also address who is harmed by the existence of the problem and why and what are
    the root causes of the problem. It might take several drafts to strip down to
    a statement of an actionable problem and its causes. But undertaking this exercise
    – especially doing so collaboratively with the participation of the key stakeholders
    involved in the issue – will help to build consensus behind the implementation
    of the project.
  questions: "- Describe issue to be addressed\n- Identify the beneficiaries\n- Explain

  stepTitle: Define the value proposition of the data collaborative
  discussion: Research and practice in data collaboratives point to a number of societal
    benefits arising from the cross-sector sharing of data. After clearly defining
    the problem that a data collaborative will serve to address, organizers should
    look to gain specificity on the specific benefit a data collaborative could offer.
    Without assessing the value of the data collaborative, tradeoffs cannot later
    be measured. To understand whether the use of a corporate data is worthwhile despite
    the risks involved, and to find the proper steps to take that mitigate risk, it
    is important to evaluate the context for the use of the data. This might involve
    an assessment of the urgency of having access to the data. Is there a disaster
    relief component or other time sensitivity? If it is hard to define the problem
    or hard to define the value, it will be impossible to evaluate the success of
    any data project. To justify the risks and the potential liability that arises
    from using and analyzing corporate data requires having a clearly articulated
    benefit that can be measured.
  questions: |-
    What is the intended societal benefit of the data collaborative?
    - Situational awareness and response?
    - Public service design and delivery?
    - Knowledge creation and transfer?
    - Prediction and forecasting?
    - Impact assessment and evaluation?

  stepTitle: Data Science Expertise and Organizational Competency
  discussion: Cross-sector data sharing requires not only the bringing together of
    diverse datasets, but also collaboration between people and organizations with
    different skills and institutional norms. An upfront understanding of how human
    and institutional capacity and cultures either do or do not mesh can help to define
    optimal roles and responsibilities and identify capacity gaps that need to be
    filled (through additional partnerships or other mechanisms).
  questions: "##### Internal\n- Evaluate and review internal capacity \n- Build high-level
    internal support\n- Identify internal data literacy and human capital \n- Collect
    and share examples of how other organizations have leveraged data\n##### External
    \n- Which entities could provide additional competencies (data science and otherwise)?\n"

  stepTitle: Data Supply
  discussion: 'In many ways, data collaboratives are means for filling gaps in existing
    institutional data supplies. In order to fill such gaps, organizers should conduct
    an upfront audit of both the existing internal data supply and the potential supply
    of data existing in other sectors. Such an audit can provide insight regarding
    the data relevant to your project, who has it, who needs it, and how it can be
    used to tackle the problem. Data audits can also help inform and prioritize outreach
    to external data holders and ensure that newly accessible datasets are well-positioned
    for filling the most important data gaps. Too often the assumption is that all
    data must be made available when only a few data points are needed. As part of
    the data inventory, other considerations may include assessing the reputation
    and reliability of those who have the data and those who want it in terms of security
    and data responsibility. In and of itself, undertaking the data inventory helps
    to mitigate risk by helping to develop strategies for how to use the data. A more
    detailed analysis by interdisciplinary experts may help to identify technical
    or procedural workarounds for seemingly difficult or expensive tasks. '
  questions: |
    ##### Internal: Conduct due diligence research and a data audit
    - What data currently exists that will be useful in addressing the problem?
    - What are the data gaps that slow progress toward addressing the problem?
    ##### External: Map the potential supply side based on identified gaps
    - Develop a data inventory – what data do you already have?
    - Which entities (whether private, governmental or nongovernmental) possess and could provide the needed data?
  examples: "- [The New York City Business Atlas](http://odimpact.org/case-united-states-new-york-city-business-atlas.html)
    was developed by the Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics (MODA) by bringing together
    open government data relevant to small businesspeople interested in opening physical
    locations in the city to inform their decisionmaking. Official datasets, however,
    did not provide a sense of the foot traffic in different areas of the city. To
    fill this gap, MODA partnered with Placemeter, a local startup that analyzes video
    imagery to understand pedestrian flows throughout the city.  \n"

  stepTitle: Select the most promising potential supply-side data providers and identify
    specific incentives for them to participate
  discussion: When and why corporations contribute their data differs according to
    the context in which the data is being requested or shared, the question access
    to their data may answer and the corporate and legal culture of the firm. Different
    corporations also have different views regarding the expected benefits and risks
    from sharing their data. As such, when firms extend themselves and share their
    data they seek to satisfy a variety of motivations.
  questions: "##### What entities are best suited for filling identified data gaps
    and/or expertise?\n##### Why would different actors be motivated to collaborate?\n-
    *Reciprocity*: corporations may share their data with others for mutual benefit,
    especially gaining access to other data sources that may be important to their
    own business decisions. Some corporations may also reciprocate due to a sense
    of “giving back that was taken” from individuals and society-at-large.\n- *Research
    & insights*: opening up their data may generate new answers to particular questions
    providing companies insights that may not have been extracted otherwise. Just
    as with open source, sharing data (and in some cases algorithms) can enable corporations
    to tap into data analytical skills (often free labor) distributed beyond the boundaries
    of their own company. External users may interrogate the data in new ways and
    use the skills and methodologies not readily available in the company. It may
    also create the potential to identify and hire valuable talent that can emerge
    from data. In addition, these insights may enable companies to identify new niches
    for activity and to develop new business models.\n- *Reputation and public relations*:
    sharing data for public good may enhance a firm’s corporate image and reputation,
    potentially attracting new users and customers. It may also offer an opportunity
    to gain (free) media attention and increase visibility among certain decision
    makers and other audiences.\n- Revenue generation: opening up corporate data does
    not always have to be for free. Under some conditions, corporate data may be offered
    for sale, generating extra revenue for firms.\n- *Regulatory compliance*: sharing
    data can also help corporations comply with sectoral regulations and becoming
    more transparent and trusted. In addition, many corporations are generating data
    often for the sole purpose of regulatory compliance. Sharing and using that data
    in a responsible manner (see below regarding some of the risks of opening up data)
    for public and private beneficial ways may leverage more broadly the investment
    made to collect the data for a narrow purpose. \n- *Responsibility and corporate
    philanthropy*: finally, sharing corporate data achieves many of the goals sought
    by traditional corporate social responsibility or philanthropy, where a company
    derives value from socially responsible behavior not just because of the positive
    image such an activity produces, but because opening up data can also improve
    the competitive business environment within which the business operates."

  discussion: 'Data collaboratives exist in a number of forms, each of which is better
    positioned for a certain problem or date type. The current field of practice shows
    that there are currently six main types of data collaboratives, the preceding
    steps in this canvas should help to make clear which of the following collaboration
    mechanisms is best-suited for the opportunity at hand.

'
  questions: "Given the insights gained during previous steps, which data collaborative
    type is best suited to the problem at hand?  \n- __Trusted Intermediary__, where
    companies share data with a limited number of known partners. Companies generally
    share data with these entities for data analysis and modeling, as well as other
    value chain activities. \n- __Prizes or Challenge__, in which companies make data
    available to qualified applicants who compete to develop new apps or discover
    innovative uses for the data. Companies typically host these contests in an effort
    to incentivize a wide range of civic hackers, pro-bono data scientists and other
    expert users to find innovative solutions with the available data.\n- __Research
    Partnership__, in which corporations share data with universities and other research
    organizations. Through partnerships with corporate data providers, several research
    organizations are conducting experiments using anonymized and aggregated samples
    of consumer datasets and other sources of data to analyze social trends.\n- __Intelligence
    Products__, where companies share (often aggregated) data that provides general
    insight into market conditions, customer demographic information, or other broad
    trends. \n- __Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)__, which allow developers
    and others to access data for testing, product development, and data analytics.
    By signing a terms of service agreement, companies give access to streams of its
    data in order to build applications.\n- __Corporate Data Cooperatives or Pooling__,
    in which corporations — and other important dataholders such as government agencies — group
    together to create “collaborative databases” with shared data resources. These
    collaborations typically require an organizing partner as well as technical and
    legal frameworks surrounding the use and distribution of the data."
  examples: |-
    - __Trusted Intermediary__: South Africa-based telecom MTN makes anonymized call records available to researchers through a trusted intermediary, Real Impacts Analytics — a data analytics firm that provides guided and predictive analytics solutions through its [Data for Good Program](http://datacollaboratives.org/cases/real-impact-analytics-data-for-good-program.html).
    - __Prizes or Challenges__: In Ivory Coast and Senegal, Orange Telecom hosted a global challenge – the [Orange Telecom Data for Development Challenge](http://datacollaboratives.org/cases/orange-telecom-data-for-development-challenge.html) – that allowed researchers to use anonymized, aggregated data to help solve various development problems, including those related to transportation, health, and agriculture.
    - __Research Partnership__: Yelp shares its data on neighborhood businesses with 30 universities for researchers to build tools and discover meaningful value in the data. Using shared data on Yelp businesses in the San Francisco Bay Area, an academic research team from U.C. Berkeley used a probabilistic model for natural language processing to detect subtopics across a dataset of over 200,000 Yelp business reviews. Their research uncovered correlations between positive ratings and service quality, giving business owners evidence for improving their services.
    - __APIs__: Facebook Open Graph Search allows for consumers and companies to mine social graphs for search query-based data, such as demographic and location data, “likes,” and multimedia. Companies such as Slate and Upworthy have used available data from Open Graph Search to optimize their headlines and increase readership.
    - __Corporate Data Cooperatives or Pooling__: Through its [Accelerating Medicines Partnership](http://datacollaboratives.org/cases/accelerating-medicines-partnership-amp.html), the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) is helping organize data pooling among the world’s largest biopharmaceutical companies in order to identify promising drug and diagnostic targets for Alzheimer’s disease.

  stepTitle: Assess major risks, ethical concerns and potential challenges
  discussion: The collection, processing, sharing, analysis and use of data introduce
    a number of risks and challenges for stakeholders involved in data collaboratives.
    Rather than seeking to mitigate the realized harms arising from those risks after
    the fact, stakeholders should seek to understand the risks at every stage of the
    data lifecycle in order to develop well-targeted strategies for mitigating them.
  questions: "##### Understand risks across the data lifecycle (with particular focus
    on the sharing and use stages)\n- **Collection**\n    - Collection of inaccurate
    or “dirty” data\n    - Unauthorized data collection\n    - Incomplete, non-representative
    sampling\n- **Analysis & Processing**\n    - Insufficient, outdated, or inflexible
    security provisions\n    - Aggregation/correlation of incomparable datasets\n
    \   - Lack of academic rigor\n    - Each of the above can heavily influence outcome
    of study or misrepresent the data\n- **Sharing**\n    - Incompatible cultural
    or institutional norms or expectations\n    - Lack of stewardship on both ends
    to ensure responsible sharing of personally identifiable information as it travels
    across cases and sectors\n    - Improper or unauthorized access to shared data\n
    \   - Conflicting legal jurisdictions and different levels of security\n- **Use**\n
    \   - Controversial or incongruous data usage\n    - Misinterpretation of data\n
    \   - Possible re-identification of individuals\n    - Decisional interference\n\n#####
    What are the relevant legal, political and cultural concerns\n- Ensuring proprietary
    data isn’t subject to Freedom of Information laws \n- Does the data collaborative
    (or the partner) raise any sensitive political concerns?\n- Does the collaboration
    comport with the cultural (and societal) expectations of all parties?\n\n#####
    List potential unintended consequences\n- Profiling and Discrimination\n- Entrenching
    Existing Biases and Power Dynamics\n\n##### Anticipate potential harms to corporations\n-
    Criminal or civil legal investigations and/or regulatory fines;\n- Loss of regulatory
    licenses, standards, certifications;\n- Reputational and industrial damages –
    impacting competitive positioning and advantage; \n    - share price and/or cost
    of capital;\n    - customer attrition rates;\n    - employee recruitment, productivity
    and retention\n- Overall increase in operating expenses \n- Anticipate potential

  stepTitle: Establish a Governance Structure
  discussion: Establishing a data collaborative requires a number of upfront efforts
    across stakeholder groups. The many decisions to be made and responsibilities
    present in such an arrangement, however, do not end at the implementation stage.
    An agreed upon governance structure for the lifespan of the data collaborative
    can help to ensure that the processes for making important decisions – whether,
    for example, related to new uses for datasets or unanticipated risks coming into
    view – are clearly defined and understood by all parties. In addition, for the
    effort to be seen as legitimate, the process of developing data collaborative
    policies needs to be collaboratively engaging and consulting with a variety of
    groups, including both private sector and impacted citizens. Such consultation
    is also part of identifying potential benefits and these steps can be brought
    together even though we distinguish between them here.
  questions: "- What will the data collaborative’s decision-making process and hierarchy
    be? \n- How can stakeholders create feedback loops to ensure that progress isn’t
    made in isolation?\n- How will concerns be acted upon? \n- What will the process
    be for taking the data collaborative in a new direction or abandoning it should
    it prove innefective?"

    With this upfront knowledge, the operational aspects of an effective data collaborative
    can be defined – with the understanding that specifics can and should be iterated
    upon as needed going forward.
  questions: "- What are the expectations of each of the entities, and how does the
    initiative align with the business (or, if relevant, philanthropic) mission of
    the participating private sector entity? \n- What is the management structure
    for the data collaborative? Who is responsible for stewarding the process?\n-

  stepTitle: 'Determine Resources: Cost and Funding Models'
  discussion: Establishing a data collaborative is often less expensive than creating
    the mechanisms to generate and collect data that is already held elsewhere, but
    there are often costs involved – including human capital costs for data scientists
    and stewards. An upfront and realistic assessment of the likely costs of the arrangement
    can inform strategic funding decisions – whether a tiered pricing model for a
    B2C, B2B or B2G data collaborative or seeking support from philanthropic and/or
    governmental grantmakers.
  questions: "- Determine cost implications \n- Identify funding partners/models"

  stepTitle: Develop a communications strategy
  discussion: Especially for data collaboratives where corporate data providers were
    incentivized to participate based on reputational benefits, communicating the
    objectives and (intended) impacts of the arrangement to the public can be important.
    In many cases, a high level of specificity in public communications may not be
    desirable, but promoting the existence of the data collaborative can spur interest
    and engagement among target audiences (including funders).
  questions: "- What are the key messages that should be communicated to the public
    regarding the data collaborative?\n- Should communication be ongoing throughout
    the initiative’s lifespan, or primarily at launch and at the impact assessment
    stage? "

  discussion: Some data collaboratives are primarily or exclusively focused on improving
    the data capacity of participating institutions. Others, however, have additional,
    external audiences or user groups. Clearly defining the audience(s) and their
    needs can enable stakeholders to craft an information sharing approach that is
    well-suited to maximizing the usefulness of newly created data-driven offerings.
  questions: "- Who are the intended beneficiaries or user groups for the data collaborative?

    discussion: Gaining a clear sense of the problem you are seeking to solve is an
      essential first step in establishing a successful data collaborative. While
      defining the problem space might seem like a straightforward proposition, achieving
      the level of precision needed for a well-targeted data collaborative requires
      an in-depth assessment of the problem space. Zeroing in on the problem can be
      difficult. To pinpoint an actionable problem with a specific data collaboration
      solution rather than a vague issue, requires writing and re-writing a one page
      Problem Statement. The Problem Statement articulates the problem with precision
      and makes assumptions explicit. It asks and answers why the problem has not
      been solved yet. It might also address who is harmed by the existence of the
      problem and why and what are the root causes of the problem. It might take several
      drafts to strip down to a statement of an actionable problem and its causes.
      But undertaking this exercise – especially doing so collaboratively with the
      participation of the key stakeholders involved in the issue – will help to build
      consensus behind the implementation of the project.

    stepTitle: Define the value proposition of the data collaborative
    discussion: Research and practice in data collaboratives point to a number of
      societal benefits arising from the cross-sector sharing of data. After clearly
      defining the problem that a data collaborative will serve to address, organizers
      should look to gain specificity on the specific benefit a data collaborative
      could offer. Without assessing the value of the data collaborative, tradeoffs
      cannot later be measured. To understand whether the use of a corporate data
      is worthwhile despite the risks involved, and to find the proper steps to take
      that mitigate risk, it is important to evaluate the context for the use of the
      data. This might involve an assessment of the urgency of having access to the
      data. Is there a disaster relief component or other time sensitivity? If it
      is hard to define the problem or hard to define the value, it will be impossible
      to evaluate the success of any data project. To justify the risks and the potential
      liability that arises from using and analyzing corporate data requires having
      a clearly articulated benefit that can be measured.
    questions: |-
      What is the intended societal benefit of the data collaborative?
      - Situational awareness and response?
      - Public service design and delivery?
      - Knowledge creation and transfer?

    stepTitle: Data Supply
    discussion: 'In many ways, data collaboratives are means for filling gaps in existing
      institutional data supplies. In order to fill such gaps, organizers should conduct
      an upfront audit of both the existing internal data supply and the potential
      supply of data existing in other sectors. Such an audit can provide insight
      regarding the data relevant to your project, who has it, who needs it, and how
      it can be used to tackle the problem. Data audits can also help inform and prioritize
      outreach to external data holders and ensure that newly accessible datasets
      are well-positioned for filling the most important data gaps. Too often the
      assumption is that all data must be made available when only a few data points
      are needed. As part of the data inventory, other considerations may include
      assessing the reputation and reliability of those who have the data and those
      who want it in terms of security and data responsibility. In and of itself,
      undertaking the data inventory helps to mitigate risk by helping to develop
      strategies for how to use the data. A more detailed analysis by interdisciplinary
      experts may help to identify technical or procedural workarounds for seemingly
      difficult or expensive tasks. '
    questions: |
      ##### Internal: Conduct due diligence research and a data audit
      - What data currently exists that will be useful in addressing the problem?
      - What are the data gaps that slow progress toward addressing the problem?
      ##### External: Map the potential supply side based on identified gaps
      - Develop a data inventory – what data do you already have?
      - Which entities (whether private, governmental or nongovernmental) possess and could provide the needed data?

    discussion: When and why corporations contribute their data differs according
      to the context in which the data is being requested or shared, the question
      access to their data may answer and the corporate and legal culture of the firm.
      Different corporations also have different views regarding the expected benefits
      and risks from sharing their data. As such, when firms extend themselves and
      share their data they seek to satisfy a variety of motivations.
    questions: "##### What entities are best suited for filling identified data gaps
      and/or expertise?\n##### Why would different actors be motivated to collaborate?\n-
      *Reciprocity*: corporations may share their data with others for mutual benefit,
      especially gaining access to other data sources that may be important to their
      own business decisions. Some corporations may also reciprocate due to a sense
      of “giving back that was taken” from individuals and society-at-large.\n- *Research
      & insights*: opening up their data may generate new answers to particular questions
      providing companies insights that may not have been extracted otherwise. Just
      as with open source, sharing data (and in some cases algorithms) can enable
      corporations to tap into data analytical skills (often free labor) distributed
      beyond the boundaries of their own company. External users may interrogate the
      data in new ways and use the skills and methodologies not readily available
      in the company. It may also create the potential to identify and hire valuable
      talent that can emerge from data. In addition, these insights may enable companies
      to identify new niches for activity and to develop new business models.\n- *Reputation
      and public relations*: sharing data for public good may enhance a firm’s corporate
      image and reputation, potentially attracting new users and customers. It may
      also offer an opportunity to gain (free) media attention and increase visibility
      among certain decision makers and other audiences.\n- Revenue generation: opening
      up corporate data does not always have to be for free. Under some conditions,
      corporate data may be offered for sale, generating extra revenue for firms.\n-
      *Regulatory compliance*: sharing data can also help corporations comply with
      sectoral regulations and becoming more transparent and trusted. In addition,
      many corporations are generating data often for the sole purpose of regulatory
      compliance. Sharing and using that data in a responsible manner (see below regarding
      some of the risks of opening up data) for public and private beneficial ways
      may leverage more broadly the investment made to collect the data for a narrow
      purpose. \n- *Responsibility and corporate philanthropy*: finally, sharing corporate
      data achieves many of the goals sought by traditional corporate social responsibility
      or philanthropy, where a company derives value from socially responsible behavior
      not just because of the positive image such an activity produces, but because
      opening up data can also improve the competitive business environment within
      which the business operates."

'
    questions: "Given the insights gained during previous steps, which data collaborative
      type is best suited to the problem at hand?  \n- __Trusted Intermediary__, where
      companies share data with a limited number of known partners. Companies generally
      share data with these entities for data analysis and modeling, as well as other
      value chain activities. \n- __Prizes or Challenge__, in which companies make
      data available to qualified applicants who compete to develop new apps or discover
      innovative uses for the data. Companies typically host these contests in an
      effort to incentivize a wide range of civic hackers, pro-bono data scientists
      and other expert users to find innovative solutions with the available data.\n-
      __Research Partnership__, in which corporations share data with universities
      and other research organizations. Through partnerships with corporate data providers,
      several research organizations are conducting experiments using anonymized and
      aggregated samples of consumer datasets and other sources of data to analyze
      social trends.\n- __Intelligence Products__, where companies share (often aggregated)
      data that provides general insight into market conditions, customer demographic
      information, or other broad trends. \n- __Application Programming Interfaces
      (APIs)__, which allow developers and others to access data for testing, product
      development, and data analytics. By signing a terms of service agreement, companies
      give access to streams of its data in order to build applications.\n- __Corporate
      Data Cooperatives or Pooling__, in which corporations — and other important
      dataholders such as government agencies — group together to create “collaborative
      databases” with shared data resources. These collaborations typically require
      an organizing partner as well as technical and legal frameworks surrounding
      the use and distribution of the data."

    discussion: The collection, processing, sharing, analysis and use of data introduce
      a number of risks and challenges for stakeholders involved in data collaboratives.
      Rather than seeking to mitigate the realized harms arising from those risks
      after the fact, stakeholders should seek to understand the risks at every stage
      of the data lifecycle in order to develop well-targeted strategies for mitigating
      them.

    discussion: Armed with a better understanding of the risks present in a data collaborative,
      organizers can develop strategies and responsibility frameworks to help mitigate
      those risks before they have real-world consequences.
    questions: "- Prioritize risks according to their likelihood of becoming reality
      and the severity of the harms they would create. \n- Consider alternative mechanisms
      or datasets that would not introduce the same level of risk.\n- Study how similar
      uses of data by other entities were either successful or unsuccessful in mitigating
      risks (e.g., through anonymization, data security techniques)\n- Ensure all
      stakeholders are in agreement regarding the ways in which risks will be mitigated,
      and the priority placed on mitigating especially salient risks\n- Continue to
      monitor risks and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies throughout the
      lifespan of the data collaborative"

    stepTitle: Establish a Governance Structure
    discussion: Establishing a data collaborative requires a number of upfront efforts
      across stakeholder groups. The many decisions to be made and responsibilities
      present in such an arrangement, however, do not end at the implementation stage.
      An agreed upon governance structure for the lifespan of the data collaborative
      can help to ensure that the processes for making important decisions – whether,
      for example, related to new uses for datasets or unanticipated risks coming
      into view – are clearly defined and understood by all parties. In addition,
      for the effort to be seen as legitimate, the process of developing data collaborative
      policies needs to be collaboratively engaging and consulting with a variety
      of groups, including both private sector and impacted citizens. Such consultation
      is also part of identifying potential benefits and these steps can be brought
      together even though we distinguish between them here.
    questions: "- What will the data collaborative’s decision-making process and hierarchy
      be? \n- How can stakeholders create feedback loops to ensure that progress isn’t
      made in isolation?\n- How will concerns be acted upon? \n- What will the process
      be for taking the data collaborative in a new direction or abandoning it should
      it prove innefective?"

  phaseTitle: Implementation
  phaseDescription: 'By stage five, all parties should have a clear understanding
    of how the arrangement will work, the key risks and strategies for addressing
    them, and the processes that will ensure the data collaborative runs as expected.
    At the implementation stage, the data collaborative is launched, but only after
    expectations, roles, timeline and cost questions are answered. As with any product
    launch, the creation of a data collaborative requires thinking about what will
    happen, when, by whom and in what order. To cross the chasm from idea to implementation
    and, for example, to persuade others to take the steps necessary to embark on
    a new plan of action, you must be able to draft an implementation memo that lays
    out the steps of the project from data sharing to use to analysis to evaluation.
    The memo also needs to address the resources that need to be secured for the data
    collaborative to become sustainable. This goes beyond mere financial budgeting
    to include physical, human, data assets and cultural conditions needed to be successful. '

    stepTitle: Agree upon expectations, roles, responsibilities, timeline and operational
      specifics of data-sharing process
    discussion: Upon completing the preceding steps, stakeholders in the data collaborative
      should possess a clear understanding of how the arrangement can be put into
      practice. With this upfront knowledge, the operational aspects of an effective
      data collaborative can be defined – with the understanding that specifics can
      and should be iterated upon as needed going forward.
    questions: "- What are the expectations of each of the entities, and how does
      the initiative align with the business (or, if relevant, philanthropic) mission
      of the participating private sector entity? \n- What is the management structure
      for the data collaborative? Who is responsible for stewarding the process?\n-
      Who are the champions in each participating entity? \n- What skills are required
      within the governing institution?\n- What information or data will be made open
      to the public\n- Other partners that need to be engaged?"

    stepTitle: 'Determine Resources: Cost and Funding Models'
    discussion: Establishing a data collaborative is often less expensive than creating
      the mechanisms to generate and collect data that is already held elsewhere,
      but there are often costs involved – including human capital costs for data
      scientists and stewards. An upfront and realistic assessment of the likely costs
      of the arrangement can inform strategic funding decisions – whether a tiered
      pricing model for a B2C, B2B or B2G data collaborative or seeking support from
      philanthropic and/or governmental grantmakers.

      were incentivized to participate based on reputational benefits, communicating
      the objectives and (intended) impacts of the arrangement to the public can be
      important. In many cases, a high level of specificity in public communications

  shortDescription: A case study examining the opening of private data by Dutch energy
    network administrator Liander.
  annotation: |
    This research has developed a monitoring framework to assess the effects of open (private) data using a case study of a Dutch energy network administrator Liander.

    Focusing on the potential impacts of open private energy data – beyond ‘smart disclosure’ where citizens are given information only about their own energy usage – the authors identify three attainable strategic goals:
    - Continuously optimize performance on services, security of supply, and costs;
    - Improve management of energy flows and insight into energy consumption;
    - Help customers save energy and switch over to renewable energy sources.

    The authors propose a seven-step framework for assessing the impacts of Liander data, in particular, and open private data more generally:
    - Develop a performance framework to describe what the program is about, description of the organization’s mission and strategic goals;
    - Identify the most important elements, or key performance areas which are most critical to understanding and assessing your program’s success;
    - Select the most appropriate performance measures;
    - Determine the gaps between what information you need and what is available;
    - Develop and implement a measurement strategy to address the gaps;
    - Develop a performance report which highlights what you have accomplished and what you have learned;
    - Learn from your experiences and refine your approach as required.

    While the authors note that the true impacts of this open private data will likely not come into view in the short term, they argue that, “Liander has successfully demonstrated that private energy companies can release open data, and has successfully championed the other Dutch network administrators to follow suit.”

    The paper presents a research study conducted on the basis of the mobile calls records shared with researchers in the framework of the Data for Development Challenge by the mobile operator Orange.

    The study discusses the data analysis approach in relation to developing a situation of Ebola diffusion built around “the interactions of multi-scale models, including viral loads (at the cellular level), disease progression (at the individual person level), disease propagation (at the workplace and family level), societal changes in migration and travel movements (at the population level), and mitigating interventions (at the abstract government policy level).”

    The authors argue that the use of their population, mobility, and simulation models provide more accurate simulation details in comparison to high-level analytical predictions and that the D4D mobile datasets provide high-resolution information useful for modeling developing regions and hard to reach locations.

    at the International Data Responsibility Conference focused on identifying emerging
    practices, opportunities and challenges confronting data collaboratives.\n\nThe
    authors list a number of privately held data sources that could create positive
    public impacts if made more accessible in a collaborative manner, including:\n-
    Data for early warning systems to help mitigate the effects of natural disasters;\n-
    Data to help understand human behavior as it relates to nutrition and livelihoods
    in developing countries;\n- Data to monitor compliance with weapons treaties;\n-
    Data to more accurately measure progress related to the UN Sustainable Development
    Goals.\n \nTo the end of identifying and expanding on emerging practice in the
    space, the authors describe a number of current data collaborative experiments,
    including:\n- __Trusted Intermediaries__: Statistics Netherlands partnered with
    Vodafone to analyze mobile call data records in order to better understand mobility
    patterns and inform urban planning.\n- __Prizes and Challenges__: Orange Telecom,
    which has been a leader in this type of Data Collaboration, provided several examples
    of the company’s initiatives, such as the use of call data records to track the
    spread of malaria as well as their experience with Challenge 4 Development.\n-
    __Research partnerships__: The Data for Climate Action project is an ongoing large-scale
    initiative incentivizing companies to share their data to help researchers answer
    particular scientific questions related to climate change and adaptation.\n- __Sharing
    intelligence products__: JPMorgan Chase shares macro economic insights they gained
    leveraging their data through the newly established JPMorgan Chase Institute.\n\nIn
    order to capitalize on the opportunities provided by data collaboratives, a number
    of needs were identified:\n- A responsible data framework;\n- Increased insight
    into different business models that may facilitate the sharing of data;\n- Capacity
    to tap into the potential value of data;\n- Transparent stock of available data
    supply; and\n- Mapping emerging practices and models of sharing."

  shortDescription: A literature review of potential barriers to public health data
    sharing.
  annotation: |-
    The authors of this report provide a “systematic literature of potential barriers to public health data sharing.” These twenty potential barriers are classified in six categories: “technical, motivational, economic, political, legal and ethical.” In this taxonomy, “the first three categories are deeply rooted in well-known challenges of health information systems for which structural solutions have yet to be found; the last three have solutions that lie in an international dialogue aimed at generating consensus on policies and instruments for data sharing.”

    The authors suggest the need for a “systematic framework of barriers to data sharing in public health” in order to accelerate access and use of data for public good.

  shortDescription: A paper describing how data, such as privately held mobile phone
    data – could improve development policy.
  annotation: |-
    This journal article describes how privately held data – namely “digital traces” of consumer activity – “are becoming seen by policymakers and researchers as a potential solution to the lack of reliable statistical data on lower-income countries."

    They focus especially on three categories of data collaborative use cases:
    - Mobile data as a predictive tool for issues such as human mobility and economic activity;
    - Use of mobile data to inform humanitarian response to crises; and
    - Use of born-digital web data as a tool for predicting economic trends, and the implications these have for LMICs.

    They note, however, that a number of challenges and drawbacks exist for these types of use cases, including:
    - Access to private data sources often must be negotiated or bought, “which potentially means substituting negotiations with corporations for those with national statistical offices;”
    - The meaning of such data is not always simple or stable, and local knowledge is needed to understand how people are using the technologies in question
    - Bias in proprietary data can be hard to understand and quantify;
    - Lack of privacy frameworks; and
    - Power asymmetries, wherein “LMIC citizens are unwittingly placed in a panopticon staffed by international researchers, with no way out and no legal recourse.”

  shortDescription: A working paper describing how privately held data sources could
    fill current gaps in the efforts of National Statistics Offices.
  annotation: |-
    This working paper acknowledges the growing body of work on how different types of data (e.g, telecom data, social media, sensors and geospatial data, etc.) can address data gaps relevant to National Statistical Offices (NSOs).

    Four models of public-private interaction for statistics are describe: in-house production of statistics by a data-provider for a national statistics office (NSO), transfer of data-sets to NSOs from private entities, transfer of data to a third party provider to manage the NSO and private entity data, and the outsourcing of NSO functions.

    The paper highlights challenges to public-private partnerships involving data (e.g., technical challenges, data confidentiality, risks, limited incentives for participation), suggests deliberate and highly structured approaches to public-private partnerships involving data require enforceable contracts, emphasizes the trade-off between data specificity and accessibility of such data, and the importance of pricing mechanisms that reflect the capacity and capability of national statistic offices.

    Case studies referenced in the paper include:
    - A mobile network operator’s (MNO Telefonica) in house analysis of call detail records;
    - A third-party data provider and steward of travel statistics (Positium);
    - The Data for Development (D4D) challenge organized by MNO Orange; and
    - Statistics Netherlands use of social media to predict consumer confidence.

  annotation: |-
    This paper discusses the concept of a “boundary organization” in relation to industry-academic partnerships driven by data. Boundary organizations perform mediated revealing, allowing firms to disclose their research problems to a broad audience of innovators and simultaneously minimize the risk that this information would be adversely used by competitors.

    The authors identify two especially important challenges for private firms to enter open data or participate in data collaboratives with the academic research community that could be addressed through more involvement from boundary organizations:
    - First is a challenge of maintaining competitive advantage. The authors note that, “the more a firm attempts to align the efforts in an open data research programme with its R&D priorities, the more it will have to reveal about the problems it is addressing within its proprietary R&D.”
    - Second, involves the misalignment of incentives between the private and academic field. Perkmann and Schildt argue that, a firm seeking to build collaborations around its opened data “will have to provide suitable incentives that are aligned with academic scientists’ desire to be rewarded for their work within their respective communities.”

  shortDescription: An analysis of aggregated and anonymized call details records
    (CDR) conducted in collaboration with the UN, Government of Mexico, academia and
    Telefonica suggests high potential in using shared telecom data to improve early
    warning and emergency management mechanisms.
  annotation: |-
    This report describes the impact of using mobile data in order to understand the impact of disasters and improve disaster management. The report was conducted in the Mexican state of Tabasco in 2009 as a multidisciplinary, multi-stakeholder consortium involving the UN World Food Programme (WFP), Telefonica Research, Technical University of Madrid (UPM), Digital Strategy Coordination Office of the President of Mexico, and UN Global Pulse.

    Telefonica Research, a division of the major Latin American telecommunications company, provided call detail records covering flood-affected areas for nine months. This data was combined with “remote sensing data (satellite images), rainfall data, census and civil protection data.” The results of the data demonstrated that “analysing mobile activity during floods could be used to potentially locate damaged areas, efficiently assess needs and allocate resources (for example, sending supplies to affected areas).”

    In addition to the results, the study highlighted “the value of a public-private partnership on using mobile data to accurately indicate flooding impacts in Tabasco, thus improving early warning and crisis management.”

    corporate data to help solve public problems.
  annotation: "This Medium post from Gideon Mann, the Head of Data Science at Bloomberg,
    shares his prepared remarks given at a lecture at the City College of New York.
    Mann argues for the potential benefits of increasing access to private sector
    data, both to improve research and academic inquiry and also to help solve practical,
    real-world problems. He also describes a number of initiatives underway at Bloomberg
    along these lines.    \n\nMann argues that data generated at private companies
    “could enable amazing discoveries and research,” but is often inaccessible to
    those who could put it to those uses. Beyond research, he notes that corporate
    data could, for instance, benefit:\n- Public health – including suicide prevention,
    addiction counseling and mental health monitoring.\n- Legal and ethical questions
    – especially as they relate to “the role algorithms have in decisions about our
    lives,” such as credit checks and resume screening.\n\nMann recognizes the privacy
    challenges inherent in private sector data sharing, but argues that it is a common
    misconception that the only two choices are “complete privacy or complete disclosure.”
    He believes that flexible frameworks for differential privacy could open up new
    opportunities for responsibly leveraging data collaboratives."

  shortDescription: A journal article primarily focused on the risks involved in health
    data pooling.
  annotation: |-
    This journal article explores the benefits and, in particular, the risks related to large-scale biomedical databases bringing together health information from a diversity of sources across sectors. Some data collaboratives examined in the piece include:
    - __MedMining__ – a company that extracts EHR data, de-identifies it, and offers it to researchers. The data sets that MedMining delivers to its customers include ‘lab results, vital signs, medications, procedures, diagnoses, lifestyle data, and detailed costs’ from inpatient and outpatient facilities.
    - __Explorys__ has formed a large healthcare database derived from financial, administrative, and medical records. It has partnered with major healthcare organizations such as the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and Summa Health System to aggregate and standardize health information from ten million patients and over thirty billion clinical events.

    Hoffman and Podgurski note that biomedical databases populated have many potential uses, with those likely to benefit including: “researchers, regulators, public health officials, commercial entities, lawyers,” as well as “healthcare providers who conduct quality assessment and improvement activities,” regulatory monitoring entities like the FDA, and “litigants in tort cases to develop evidence concerning causation and harm.”

    They argue, however, that risks arise based on:
    - The data contained in biomedical databases is surprisingly likely to be incorrect or incomplete;
    - Systemic biases, arising from both the nature of the data and the preconceptions of investigators are serious threats the validity of research results, especially in answering causal questions;
    - Data mining of biomedical databases makes it easier for individuals with political, social, or economic agendas to generate ostensibly scientific but misleading research findings for the purpose of manipulating public opinion and swaying policymakers.

    Interventions include a model where data is shared only with a few trusted organizations,
    and yield management mechanisms to ensure negative financial consequences are
    avoided.\n- __Data quality__. Interventions include identifying additional data
    sources that could improve the completeness of datasets, and efforts to improve
    metadata.\n- __Technical__. Interventions include making data available in structured

    This Chatham House report provides an overview on public health surveillance data sharing, highlighting the benefits and challenges of shared health data and the complexity in adapting technical solutions from other sectors for public health.

    The report describes data sharing processes from several perspectives, including in-depth case studies of actual data sharing in practice at the individual, organizational and sector levels. Among the key lessons for public health data sharing, the report strongly highlights the need to harness momentum for action and maintain collaborative engagement: “Successful data sharing communities are highly collaborative. Collaboration holds the key to producing and abiding by community standards, and building and maintaining productive networks, and is by definition the essence of data sharing itself. Time should be invested in establishing and sustaining collaboration with all stakeholders concerned with public health surveillance data sharing.”

    Examples of data collaboratives include H3Africa (a collaboration between NIH and Wellcome Trust) and NHS England’s care.data programme.

  shortDescription: A white paper describing the potential of big data, and corporate
    data in particular, to positively benefit development efforts.
  annotation: |-
    This white paper, produced by “a group of activists, researchers and data experts” explores the potential of big data to improve development outcomes and spur positive social change in low- and middle-income countries. Using examples, the authors discuss four areas in which the use of big data can impact development efforts:
    - Advocating and facilitating by “opening[ing] up new public spaces for discussion and awareness building;
    - Describing and predicting through the detection of “new correlations and the surfac[ing] of new questions;
    -  Facilitating information exchange through “multiple feedback loops which feed into both research and action,” and
    -  Promoting accountability and transparency, especially as a byproduct of crowdsourcing efforts aimed at “aggregat[ing] and analyz[ing] information in real time.

    The authors argue that in order to maximize the potential of big data’s use in development, “there is a case to be made for building a data commons for private/public data, and for setting up new and more appropriate ethical guidelines.”

    They also identify a number of challenges, especially when leveraging data made accessible from a number of sources, including private sector entities, such as:
    - Lack of general data literacy;
    - Lack of open learning environments and repositories;
    - Lack of resources, capacity and access;
    - Challenges of sensitivity and risk perception with regard to using data;
    - Storage and computing capacity; and
    - Externally validating data sources for comparison and verification.

    ethical values. \n- The report has four main recommendations for stakeholders
    that will share data: 1) that stakeholders should encourage and foster a professional
    environment in which the responsible sharing of data is the norm; 2) that data
    should be shared within certain timeframes specified within the report; 3) that
    stakeholders should employ operational strategies designed to mitigate risk and
    maximize benefits; and 4) that the sponsors of the IOM study ought to take the
    lead in creating an international framework and infrastructure related to responsible
    sharing of clinical trial data. "

    Verhulst analyses how an increasing number of companies are using their data for
    social good, evidence for a new concept of “data responsibility” where data and

    as steps companies can take to open their proprietary data to external bodies,
    who can use this information to confront humanitarian emergencies and public problems.
    Central to this is the creation of “Data Collaboratives”—data-sharing models between
    corporations and public institutions, NGOs, and academic bodies. \nThe article
    goes on to detail the “Three Pillars of Data Responsibility” which include:\n•\tShare:
    the duty for data-holders to share their data.\n•\tProtect: the need to protect
    data through adequate anonymization techniques.\n•\tAct: the need for policy makers
    and leaders to act upon the information and data shared.\nThe article ends by
    calling on a “culture shift” to incorporate concepts of data responsibility into
    day-to-day company activities, and outlying four practical steps to make this
    happen.\n"

    Purpose
    In “data collaboratives”, private and public organizations coordinate their activities to leverage data to address a societal challenge. This paper aims to focus on analyzing challenges and coordination mechanisms of data collaboratives.

    Design/methodology/approach
    This study uses coordination theory to identify and discuss the coordination problems and coordination mechanisms associated with data collaboratives. The authors also use a taxonomy of data collaborative forms from a previous empirical study to discuss how different forms of data collaboratives may require different coordination mechanisms.

    Findings
    The study analyzed data collaboratives from the perspective of organizational and task levels. At the organizational level, the authors argue that data collaboratives present an example of the bazaar form of coordination. At the task level, the authors identified five coordination problems and discussed potential coordination mechanisms to address them, such as coordination by negotiation, by third party, by standardization, to name a few.

    Research limitations/implications
    This study is one of the first few to systematically analyze the phenomenon of “data collaboratives”.

    Practical implications
    This study can help practitioners better understand the coordination challenges they may face when initiating a data collaborative and to develop successful data collaboratives by using coordination mechanisms to mitigate these challenges.

    Originality/value
    Data collaboratives are a novel form of data-driven initiatives which have seen rapid experimentation lately. This study draws attention to this concept in the academic literature and highlights some of the complexities of organizing data collaboratives in practice.

  url: https://gking.harvard.edu/partnerships
  annotation: 'The mission of the academic social sciences is to understand and ameliorate
    society’s greatest challenges. The data held by private companies holds vast potential
    to further this mission. Yet, because of its interaction with highly politicized
    issues, customer privacy, proprietary content, and differing goals of firms and
    academics, these data are often inaccessible to university researchers. We propose
    here a new model for industry-academic partnerships that addresses these problems
    via a novel organizational structure: Respected scholars form a commission which,
    as a trusted third party, receives access to all relevant firm information and
    systems, and then recruits independent academics to do research in specific areas
    following standard peer review protocols organized and funded by nonprofit foundations.
    We also report on a partnership we helped forge under this model to make data
    available about the extremely visible and highly politicized issues surrounding
    the impact of social media on elections and democracy. In our partnership, Facebook
    will provide privacy-preserving data and access; seven major politically and substantively
    diverse nonprofit foundations will fund the research; and the Social Science Research
    Council will oversee the peer review process for funding and data access.'

    data for forecasting price series in Central America. It discusses some of the
    challenges inherent in working with it in the context of developing countries.
    It finds that the addition of the Internet search index improves forecasting over
    benchmark models in about 20 percent of the series and discusses the reasons for
    the varied success and potential avenues for future research.
  annotation: |
    - Seabold and Coppola obtained the consumer price data from the statistical office of each country, and also Google Trends data on a number of search keywords and found that the Google Trends data improved nowcasts of price, compared to an ARMA model and other respective benchmarks
    - They conclude by saying that "the study of the manifestation of consumer sentiment via Internet search behavior is very much still in its infancy. It certainly presents a number of challenges, but the potential insights and use cases are varied and exciting. It may be tempting to dismiss this excitement as hype. All the same, it is difficult to deny the possible benefits of real-time consumer sentiment to future economics research and forecasting studies."

  title: Data Collaboratives to Improve Children’s Lives
  shortDescription: How can we leverage cross-sector data-sharing to improve the lives
    of children?
  longDescription: Recent years have seen exponential growth in the amount of data
    being generated and stored around the world. There is increasing recognition that
    this data can play a key role in solving some of the most difficult public problems
    we face – including problems facing children around the world. However, much of
    the potentially useful data is currently privately held and not available for
    public insights. Data in the form of web clicks, social “likes,” geolocation and
    online purchases are typically tightly controlled, usually by entities in the
    private sector. Companies today generate an ever-growing stream of information
    from our proliferating sensors and devices. Increasingly, they—and various other
    actors—are asking if there is a way to make this data available for the public
    good. There is an ongoing search for new models of corporate responsibility in
    the digital era around data toward the creation of “data collaboratives”.

  title: The Potential of Social Media Intelligence to Improve People's Lives
  shortDescription: Social Media Data for Good
  longDescription: |-
    The twenty-first century will be challenging on many fronts. From historically catastrophic natural disasters resulting from climate change to inequality to refugee and terrorism crises, it is clear that we need not only new solutions, but new insights and methods of arriving at solutions. Data, and the intelligence gained from it through advances in data science, is increasingly being seen as part of the answer. This report explores the premise that data—and in particular the vast stores of data and the unique analytical expertise held by social media companies—may indeed provide for a new type of intelligence that could help develop solutions to today’s challenges.

    In this report, developed with support from Facebook, we focus on an approach to extract public value from social media data that we believe holds the greatest potential: data collaboratives. Data collaboratives are an emerging form of public-private partnership in which actors from different sectors exchange information to create new public value. Such collaborative arrangements, for example between social media companies and humanitarian organizations or civil society actors, can be seen as possible templates for leveraging privately held data towards the attainment of public goals.

  title: Gender and Urban Mobility
  shortDescription: Leveraging data collaboratives to make urban transportation planning
    more gender-inclusive
  longDescription: "As part of the Data2X initiative, The GovLab, UNICEF, Universidad
    del Desarrollo/Telefónica R&D Center, ISI Foundation, and DigitalGlobe have joined
    forces to determine if gender plays a role in the way people move in megacities,
    and how transportation planning can become more gender-inclusive.\n\nSantiago,
    Chile, was selected as the first location for the multi-dimensional research study,
    and the multi-national team will use Data Collaboratives as the platform for aggregating
    and analyzing a mix of corporate and open government data around gender and urban
    mobility.\n\nGreater access to data on gender and urban mobility can inform regulations,
    policies and programs that help address real-world challenges experienced by women
    and children, and increase their safety and security. And Data Collaboratives
    offer a vehicle for understanding the intelligence gathered from public and private
    data sources to surface possible solutions. \n\nThe Santiago project team is creating
    a Data Collaborative on Gender and Urban Mobility to pair official government
    data (census, transport, crime report, socioeconomic indicators) with high-definition
    satellite imagery from DigitalGlobe, and aggregated, anonymized Call Detail Records
    from Telefonica to create create a human landscape and mobility map of Santiago.
