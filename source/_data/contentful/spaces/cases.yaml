  whatDataShared: This collaboration between Community Care of North Carolina, Inc.
    (CCNC) with GSK and the UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy (The School) uses patient
    data disclosed in electronic health records to better coordinate healthcare efforts.
    A particular part of this collboration is the Care TriageTM project that uses
    small data sets from pharmacies to help better supervise patient treatment.
  howDataShared: The collaborative centers on establishing “patient-centered medical
    homes” – virtual homes for an individual’s healthcare – that provide patients
    with a single point-of-contact to help coordinate their medical care, arrange
    care with other caregivers when necessary, and house electronic health records.
  purpose: The collaboration aims to lower health care costs and improve health outcomes
    by building on the insights gained through the data in electronic health records.
    By sharing data with pharmacists, the project also aims to identify patients at
    risk for hospitalization and drug therapy problems and provide pharmacists with
    new tools and resources to efficiently deliver comprehensive medication management
    services to appropriate patients at the right time with the right interventions.

  whatDataShared: 'ConvergeHEALTH, a product from Delloite, uses its OutcomesMiner
    analytics platform to generate real-world clinical insights based on patient data,
    and has previously partnered with pharmaceutical company Allergan as part of a
    research collaboration. In this initiative, Intermountain Healthcare--a Utah-based,
    not-for-profit system of 22 hospitals, 185 clinics, and some 1,300 employed physicians--will
    collaborate through its Homer Warner Center for Informatics Research in conducting
    follow-on studies to support the insights generated by ConvergeHEALTH and Allergan. '
  howDataShared: Though this cross-sector collaboration uses patient, clinical, pharmaceutical
    and propiertory data to improve health outcomes, it is unusual in that it is a
    for-profit collaborative. Delloite's ConvergeHEALTH product is an intelligence
    product sold to participating organizations, like Intermountatin Healthcare, to
    provide "applied analytics solutions" with the aim of improving health care. Allergan
    is similarly a for-profit pharmaceutical company, and it is unclear whether their
    research collaboration with ConvergeHEALTH is commercial or not.
  purpose: This collaboration aims to enable data driven improvements to clinical
    care, and consequently improve patient health outcomes.

  howDataShared: InBloom was a non-profit student data repository, that made available
    standardized student and school data for creating approved third party applications
    and software designed for educators. It collected information from school districts'
    many databases, and stored these in the cloud, protected with high-level encryption.
    The inBloom database included more than 400 different data fields about students
    that school administrators could fill in. But, since some of the details seemed
    personal, like family relationships and enrollment changes, some parents objected,
    saying that they did not want that kind of information about their children transferred
    to a third-party vendor.

    and educators over the collection, use and storage of personally identifiable
    information on students, causing many partners to back out of initial agreements.

  howDataShared: Researchers at Karolinska Institutet and Columbia University in New
    York sought the cooperation of Digicel, the largest mobile phone operator in Haiti,
    and started to monitor the daily movements of two million mobile phones by analysing
    anonymised data on which mobile phone towers were used to make calls. They then
    reported their analyses directly to the UN and other aid organisations working
    in Haiti.
  purpose: Nearly 200,000 SIMs that were present in Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince
    when the earthquake struck had left 19 days post-earthquake. Just under a third
    of Port-au-Prince's residents were mobile phone subscribers at the time of the
    earthquake, so this movement of SIMs equates to the movement of 630,000 people.
    With this information, researchers were able to better understand the needs and
    reponse of victims of the earthquake, and better planned relief and aid strategies.

  whatDataShared: The Global Forest Watch (GFW) ArcGIS Online portal is an added analytical
    tool to the GFW platform allowing users to use this forest data in a GIS cloud
    environment. ArcGIS Online resources include thousands of authoritative datasets,
    references, and thematic maps about hundreds of topics. Users can also contribute
    to GFW by sharing data and stories from the ground via GFW’s crowdsourcing tools,
    blogs, and discussion groups. Special “apps” provide detailed information for
    companies that wish to reduce the risk of deforestation in their supply chains,
    users who want to monitor fires across Southeast Asia, and more.
  howDataShared: "Data on Global Forest Watch come from a variety of sources, including
    governments, NGOs, academia, and industry. To acquire new data, they research
    and incorporate available open data, form partnerships to move data into the public
    domain, and fund the creation of data sets to fill key gaps.  Generally, the process
    begins with a conversation between GFW and the data provider about which data
    sets will be visualized. The data provider will also be asked to sign a Data Sharing
    Agreement, which gives Global Forest Watch permission to visualize the data on
    the website and (in most cases) make the data downloadable. \n"
  purpose: |-
    In its Data Playbook, Global Forest Watch lists three central intended impacts:
    1. Improve the accuracy or timeliness of forest change detection.
    2. Illustrate drivers of change, including land use and industrial activity. Priority sectors include logging, mining, agricultural commodities (palm oil, beef, soy, etc.), and infrastructure.
    3. Indicate the health or status of remaining forests, such as biodiversity, landscape connectivity, or carbon.”
    Government officials benefit from the project as they can see where forest clearing is happening in near real-time or sign up for alerts
    Law enforcement can stop illegal logging before more is lost
    Business managers buying commodities such as palm oil, soy, bean or wood pole can to see if supplies are clearing forests they committed to protect
    Local farmers can raise the alarm when a community’s forests are threatened by uploading a call to action from a mobile phone
    Everyone can participate in reviewing the satellite data, sharing stories from the ground, using the information to campaign for change.

  purpose: The partnership provides information to growers and helps them improve
    their decision making about when to plant or not plant, as well as which varieties
    are most likely to have the best yields in the forecasted conditions. The site-specific
    information had an enormous economic impact. In 2013, when CSAC predicted a high
    risk of crop loss due to drought, farmers who did not plant saved $3.6 million
    in agricultural inputs that would have been spent on the failed crop.

    Kenyan mobile phone subscribers to one of 11,920 cell towers located in 692 different
    settlements. Every time an individual left his or her primary settlement, the
    destination and duration of each journey was calculated. Then, using a 2009 malaria
    prevalence map provided by co-authors at the Kenya Medical Research Institute
    (KEMRI) and the Malaria Atlas Project to estimate the disease’s prevalence in
    each location being studied, they inferred each resident’s probability of being
    infected and the daily probability that visitors to particular areas would become
    infected.The phone company, Safari, provided de-identified business data to researchers
    that was then used to model the travel patterns of cell phone users.  Neither
    the names of individuals nor their phone numbers were or are known to the Harvard
    School of Public Health researchers. \n"
  purpose: By analyzing the incidence of malaria and the movement of people as revealed
    by thei mobile phones, researchers at Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) and
    seven other institutions indicated that malaria, in large part, emanates from
    Kenya’s Lake Victoria region and spreads east, chiefly toward the capital, Nairobi.
    Such insights help estmate malaria's potantial spread, and can be used to build
    a "map of parasite movements" and help better understand the spread of disease.

    practices.  Its methodology was to find the best matches among 50 million search
    terms to fit 1152 data points.  But, since the alogorithm was too broad and the
    big data often overfitted the case--for instance, mistakenly identifying seasonal
    search terms, like “high school basketball”, as flu predictions--Google Flu Trends
    missed 2013's peak flu season by 140 percent. The project now exists as a compilation
    of histori estimates, though it has also inspired several other similar projects

    Flu Trends was able to predict regional outbreaks of flu up to 10 days before
    they were reported by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). But,

    from the commercial sector
  annotation: |-
    The Chatham House report provides an overview on public health surveillance data sharing, highlighting the benefits and challenges of shared health data and the complexity in adapting technical solutions from other sectors for public health.

    The report describes data sharing processes from several perspectives, including in-depth case studies of actual data sharing in practice at the individual, organizational and sector levels. Among the key lessons for public health data sharing, the report strongly highlights the need to harness momentum for action and maintain collaborative engagement: “Successful data sharing communities are highly collaborative. Collaboration holds the key to producing and abiding by community standards, and building and maintaining productive networks, and is by definition the essence of data sharing itself. Time should be invested in establishing and sustaining collaboration with all stakeholders concerned with public health surveillance data sharing.”

    Examples of data collaboratives include H3Africa (a collaboration between NIH and Wellcome Trust) and NHS England’s care.data programme.

    each barrier:\n\n- Ownership. Possible interventions likely require improving
    trust among those who own the data through, for example, involvement and support
    from higher management\n- Privacy. Interventions include “anonymization by filtering
    of sensitive information and aggregation of data,” and access control mechanisms
    built around identity management and regulated access.  \n- Economic. Interventions
    include a model where data is shared only with a few trusted organizations, and
    yield management mechanisms to ensure negative financial consequences are avoided.\n-
    Data quality. Interventions include identifying additional data sources that could
    improve the completeness of datasets, and efforts to improve metadata.\n- Technical.
    Interventions include making data available in structured formats and publishing
    data according to widely agreed upon data standards.\n"

    This journal article explores the benefits and, in particular, the risks related to large-scale biomedical databases bringing together health information from a diversity of sources across sectors. Some data collaboratives examined in the piece include:
    - __MedMining__ – a company that extracts EHR data, de-identifies it, and offers it to researchers. The data sets that MedMining delivers to its customers include ‘lab results, vital signs, medications, procedures, diagnoses, lifestyle data, and detailed costs’ from inpatient and outpatient facilities.
    - __Explorys__ has formed a large healthcare database derived from financial, administrative, and medical records. It has partnered with major healthcare organizations such as the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and Summa Health System to aggregate and standardize health information from ten million patients and over thirty billion clinical events.

    Hoffman and Podgurski note that biomedical databases populated have many potential uses, with those likely to benefit including: “researchers, regulators, public health officials, commercial entities, lawyers,” as well as “healthcare providers who conduct quality assessment and improvement activities,” regulatory monitoring entities like the FDA, and “litigants in tort cases to develop evidence concerning causation and harm.”

    They argue, however, that risks arise based on:
    - The data contained in biomedical databases is surprisingly likely to be incorrect or incomplete;
    - Systemic biases, arising from both the nature of the data and the preconceptions of investigators are serious threats the validity of research results, especially in answering causal questions;
    - Data mining of biomedical databases makes it easier for individuals with political, social, or economic agendas to generate ostensibly scientific but misleading research findings for the purpose of manipulating public opinion and swaying policymakers.

  shortDescription: A white paper describing the potential of big data, and corporate
    data in particular, to positively benefit development efforts
  annotation: |-
    This white paper, produced by “a group of activists, researchers and data experts” explores the potential of big data to improve development outcomes and spur positive social change in low- and middle-income countries. Using examples, the authors discuss four areas in which the use of big data can impact development efforts:

    - Advocating and facilitating by “opening[ing] up new public spaces for discussion and awareness building;
    - Describing and predicting through the detection of “new correlations and the surfac[ing] of new questions;
    - Facilitating information exchange through “multiple feedback loops which feed into both research and action,” and
    - Promoting accountability and transparency, especially as a byproduct of crowdsourcing efforts aimed at “aggregat[ing] and analyz[ing] information in real time.

    The authors argue that in order to maximize the potential of big data’s use in development, “there is a case to be made for building a data commons for private/public data, and for setting up new and more appropriate ethical guidelines.”

    They also identify a number of challenges, especially when leveraging data made accessible from a number of sources, including private sector entities, such as:

    - Lack of general data literacy;
    - Lack of open learning environments and repositories;
    - Lack of resources, capacity and access;
    - Challenges of sensitivity and risk perception with regard to using data;
    - Storage and computing capacity; and
    - Externally validating data sources for comparison and verification.

  discussion: Research and practice in data collaboratives point to a number of societal
    benefits arising from the cross-sector sharing of data. After clearly defining
    the problem that a data collaborative will serve to address, organizers should
    look to gain specificity on the specific benefit a data collaborative could offer.
  questions: |-
    What is the intended societal benefit of the data collaborative:
    - Accurate, real-time monitoring of situations?
    - Agile governance in policy making and public service delivery?
    - Evidence-based problem solving and decision making?
    - Improved anticipatory mechanisms for problems and opportunities?
    - Wider variety of problem solvers working collaboratively to solve complex problems?
