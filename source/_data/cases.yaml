  - Ten biopharmaceutical companies

  - National Institutes of Health
  - U.S. Food and Drug Administration
  region: North America

  whatDataShared: AMP partners focus on four diseasesâ€”Alzheimer's disease, type 2
    diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus--and
    share genomic and molecular data to accelerate research into disease treatmeant.
  howDataShared: All AMP partners have agreed to make the AMP data and analyses publicly
    accessible to the broad biomedical community through an online portal. AMP governs
    their projects through steering committees for each of the three disease areas,
    with representation from all partners. The steering committees are managed by
    the Foundation of the National Institute of Health (FNIH) under the direction
    of an AMP Executive Committee comprised of representatives from NIH, participating
    industry leaders, FDA, and non-profit organizations.
  purpose: The AMP initiative combines public-private expertise and pooled data to
    reduce the time and cost of developing biomarkers for disease treatment. The project
    attempts to overcome fragmentation in the pharmaceutical industry and improve
    innovation in drug therapy. By combining data, the AMP portal can find new drug
    targets, and reduces wasteful repetition of testing found when companies work
    in-silo.

  whatDataShared: 23andMe shares its database of anonymized genetic data from more
    than 650,000 customers who decide to participate on the online medical studies.
    The ResearchKit app, developed in partnership with Apple, allows participants
    to integrate their genetic data  with large-scale medical studies.
  howDataShared: Medical studies initiated by partner institutions, like the Mount
    Sinai Asthma Health and Stanford Medicine's MyHeart Counts projects, can access
    23andMe research services through a new ResearchKit App, through which customers
    can choose to share data. Customers of 23andMe's services can also choose to participate
    in other surveys to aid medical research, and provide data to 23andMe's industry,
    academic and non-profit partners.
  purpose: The data collaborative allows research partners to quickly run queries
    on more than 1,000 diseases, conditions, and traits so that they can identify
    new associations between genetic markers using the 23andMe data. A single customer
    who chooses to opt into research contributes to over 230 studies on a variety
    of health topics. This effectively accelerates medical research, leading to significant
    discoveries in a fraction of the cost and time.
