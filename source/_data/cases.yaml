  whatDataShared: 23andMe shares its database of anonymized genetic data from more
    than 650,000 customers who decide to participate on the online medical studies.
    The ResearchKit app, developed in partnership with Apple, allows participants
    to integrate their genetic data  with large-scale medical studies.
  howDataShared: Medical studies initiated by partner institutions, like the Mount
    Sinai Asthma Health and Stanford Medicine's MyHeart Counts projects, can access
    23andMe research services through a new ResearhKit App, through which customers
    can choose to share data. Customers of 23andMe's services can also choose to participate
    in other surveys to aid medical research, and provide data to 23andMe's industry,
    academic and non-profit partners.
  purpose: The data collaborative allows research partners to quickly run queries
    on more than 1,000 diseases, conditions, and traits so that they can identify
    new associations between genetic markers using the 23andMe data. A single customer
    who chooses to opt into research contributes to over 230 studies on a variety
    of health topics. This effectively accelerates medical research, leading to significant
    discoveries in a fraction of the cost and time.
