          However, much of the data valuable for solving public problems actually resides within the private sector — for example, in the form of click histories, online purchases, sensor data, and call detail records. While the potential and realized impact of open data is increasingly <a href="http://odimpact.org/">recognized</a>, if we truly want to leverage the potential of data to improve people’s lives, then we need to accelerate the creation and use of “data collaboratives.”

        <h5>Using mobile phone data for disaster recovery:</h5>
        <p class="dual-panel__p--mod">
          On April 25th, 2015, a violent earthquake hit Nepal—the worst of its kind since 1934. The damage left hundreds of thousands of people homeless and flattened entire villages. The earthquake also triggered huge avalanches on Mount Everest, killing 21 people and making it the deadliest day on the mountain in history. Ultimately, the Gorkha earthquake killed nearly 9,000 people and injured nearly 22,000.

        <p class="dual-panel__p--mod">
          Yet, the death toll could have been much worse. Ncel, Nepal’s largest mobile operator, shared anonymized mobile phone data the non-profit Swedish organization Flowminder. With this data, Flowminder mapped where and how people were moving in the wake of the disaster, and shared this information with government and UN agencies to assist their relief efforts.

          The <b>Data Collaborative</b> between Ncel and Flowminder allowed humanitarian organizations to better target aid to affected communities - saving hundreds if not thousands of lives.
